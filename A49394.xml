            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I will confeſs if you will Pardon me that I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſecretly repin'd at this thy good luck and envied the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

and the Pleaſure which this Advantage gave you, and can you blame me ſince it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded me from a ſhare in one of the moſt raviſhing Delights of Friendſhip? You know what Attempts I have made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem this Inequality, but all in vain till now: Now I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my ſelf that I have found a Preſent to make you that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not provoke your Generoſity tho' it were Nicer and more ſcrupulous than 'tis; I have now at length found a way to End moſt happily, the only Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that ever has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us in an uninterrupted Friendſhip of near Seventeen years: You ſhall always be For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, always able to do Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and be in need of none;

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT has pleas'd God that in a few Years I ſhould finiſh the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and delightful part of Life, if Senſe were to be the Judge, and Standard of Pleaſure; being confin'd (I will not ſay condemn'd) by well-nigh utter Blindneſs to Retirement, and Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. In this ſtate Converſation has loſt much of it's former air, and briskneſs; Buſineſs (wherein I could never pretend to any great Addreſs) gives me now more trouble than formerly; and that too without the uſual diſpatch or ſucceſs: Study (which is the only Employment left me) is clog'd with this Weight and Incumbrance, that all the Aſſiſtance I can receive from without, muſt be convey'd by another's Senſes not my own; which it may eaſily be believ'd, are Inſtruments, or Organs as ill fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and as awkwardly manag'd by me,
<pb facs="tcp:101160:6"/>
as wooden Legs, or Hands by the Maim'd.</p>
            <p>In this Caſe, ſhould I affect to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure my ſelf a decent Funeral, and leave an Honorable Remembrance of me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; ſhould I ſtruggle to Reſcue my ſelf from that Contempt to which this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (wherein I may ſeem lost to the World, and my ſelf) expoſes me; ſhould I ambitiouſly affect to have my Name march in the train of thoſe All (tho' not all equally) great ones, <hi>Homer, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius, Cn. Aufidius, Didymus, Walkup, Pere Jean l'aveugle,</hi> &amp;c. All of them eminent for their ſervice and uſefulneſs, as well as for their affliction of the ſame kind with mine; Even this might ſeem almoſt a Commendable Infirmity, for the laſt thing a Mind truly great, and Philoſophical puts off,<note place="margin">Tacit. Hiſt. l. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note> is the Deſire of Glory: Hence <hi>Tacitus</hi> cloſes his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Character of <hi>Helvidius Priſcus</hi> thus, <hi>Erant quibus appetentior fama vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur, quando etiam ſapientibus cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do gloriae noviſſima exuitur:</hi> But this Treatiſe oweth neither its Conception, nor Birth to this Principle; for beſides that I know my own Inſufficiency too well,
<pb facs="tcp:101160:6"/>
to flatter my ſelf with the hopes of a Romantick Immortality from any perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of mine in this Ingenious, and Learned Age; I muſt confeſs I never had a Soul great enough to be acted by the Heroic heat which the love of Fame and Honour hath kindled in ſome.</p>
            <q>—Tuta &amp; parvula laudo.</q>
            <p>I have ever lov'd the Security and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of Privacy and Retirement al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the guilt of Singularity, and Affectation.</p>
            <p>But the truth is plainly this, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and Activity of my Mind, the health and ſtrength of my body (being now in the flower of my Age) continuing unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, unbent under this Affliction; I found that if I did not provide ſome Imployment that might Entertain my Mind, it would weary out it ſelf with fruitleſs Deſires of and Vain Attempts after its wonted Objects, and ſo that Strength and Vivacity of Nature which ſhould render my ſtate more Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, would make it much more Into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.</p>
            <p>I confeſs my Zeal for Public Good by the Propagation and Endearment of
<pb facs="tcp:101160:7"/>
Divine Truths was leſs fervent in me, than could well become the particular Obligations of my Profeſſion; or the Common ones which every Chriſtian in proportion to his Talents lies under; I was almoſt induced to believe, that this Chaſtiſement which had remov'd me from the Service of the Altar, did at the ſame time diſcharge me from all Duty owing to the Public; But my good Friend Mr. <hi>Lamb</hi> reviv'd the Dying ſparks of a decaying Zeal, and reſtor'd me to a proper ſenſe of my Duty in this Point; for whether by Deſign or by Providence governing Chance, I know not, (for he never ſeem'd to addreſs or deſign the Diſcourſe particularly to me) he had ever and anon in his mouth this Excellent Principle, <hi>That the life of Man is to be eſtimated by its uſefulneſs and ſerviceableneſs in the World.</hi> A ſober reflection upon this wrought me up to a Reſolution ſtrong enough to contemn all the Difficulties which the loſs of my Sight could repreſent to me in an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize of this Nature. Thus you ſee on what Principles I became engag'd in this Work; I thought it my Duty to ſet
<pb facs="tcp:101160:7"/>
my ſelf ſome Task which might ſerve at once to divert my Thoughts from a melancholy Application on my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and Entertain my Mind with ſuch a Rational Employment as might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me moſt eaſie to my ſelf, and moſt ſerviceable to the World. Being now abundantly convinc'd that I am not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd from that Duty I owe that Body of which I am ſtill a Member, by being cut off from a great part of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Advantages of it; therefore like one that truely loves his Countrey, when no way elſe is left him, he fights for't on his ſtumps, ſo will I even in the Remains of a broken body expreſs at leaſt my affection for Mankind, and breath out my laſt Gaſp in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>The fitneſs, and tendency of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſerve theſe Ends is ſo apparent, that I will not impertinently detain the Reader by a Juſtification of this Choice. How fit I am for it, will be beſt judg'd by the Performance; yet that this may not ſuffer any Diſadvantage from ſuch Prejudices with which the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my ſtate may eaſily prepoſſeſs
<pb facs="tcp:101160:8"/>
Men, I think my ſelf oblig'd to ſome ſort of Juſtification of my ſelf.</p>
            <p>I have had ſo much Experience of all the ſeveral Pleaſures that Proſperity can afford Man in this life, that I am ſufficiently Capable of ſetting a true Rate and Value upon them; and of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Subſerviency to true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And I am ſo well acquainted with Trouble and Affliction, that I am ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſenſible, as of the weakneſs of Humane Nature and Miſery of this Mortal ſtate; ſo of the Neceſſity, and Power of Vertue in Relieving and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Man under both: And after all, my Mind lives now in the Body (like a Soul in a ſeparate ſtate) retir'd as from the Pleaſures, ſo from the Troubles of the World, and is therefore the more able to paſs a free, and more diſpaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Judgment upon both.</p>
            <p>It may probably be fear'd that the ſame ſhould befall me, which has many <hi>Monkiſh</hi> Writers, who being much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd from the World, having much lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and few Books, did ſpin out every Subject into wandring Mazes, and airy Speculations, like Plants which deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb facs="tcp:101160:8"/>
of a well manur'd and fat ſoil run all into the Exuberancy of Leaves and fruitleſs Sprigs: but the Commerce I ſtill maintain with the World may in part prevent this Errour, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Subject ſo fruitful of many Neceſſary Enquiries will of it ſelf lead me on to uſeful and profitable Thoughts.</p>
            <p>There is one thing which may be by ſome objected against my manner of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Subject, the freedom I uſe in it; being not altogether ſo common to my Profeſſion; but I hope it will not be found that I have abus'd the Liberty I have taken to the Diſparagement of the least Truth of our Religion, or to the least Diſcouragement of Vertue; and therefore I think it cannot juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect any Diſadvantage upon my Calling.</p>
            <p>Beſides I have in a former Treatiſe wherein I deſign'd the ſame End, <hi>The Happineſs of Mankind,</hi> treated this Subject in a manner ſuited to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Readers: but this Diſcourſe I deſign for ſuch who are not content to ſubmit to Inferences deduc'd from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Principles, unleſs they can be fairly

Convin'd of the Reaſonableneſs and Truth of the Principles themſelves: nor ſhould I think it any Crime, were I Maſter of ſuch Talents, if I did mingle with Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Truths all that variety of Thought, all that fineneſs and briskneſs of fancy which might render them as delightful as uſeful, the Example of God himſelf in the great Work of the Creation would justifie this Liberty, who has Created as well Leaves and Flowers, as Herbs and Fruit, and in the variety and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the Colours and figures of all that he has produc'd; he appears plainly to have made proviſion not only to feed the Appetite, but even the fancies of his Creatures.</p>
            <p>There is after all I confeſs one thing that ſtands in need of an Excuſe, which is the publiſhing what ſhould come forth a just Treatiſe by ſmall Parts; to this I may truly ſay, having laid together all the Materials I ſaw neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to compleat this Diſcourſe, I found it grown unavoidably to that Volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Bulk, that I took this Method partly out of compliance to the Eaſe of my Reader, but eſpecially in compliance
<pb facs="tcp:101160:9"/>
to my own; for in my preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I ſaw no other way to avoid that Confuſion which would inevitably have diſorder'd the Contexture of a long Diſcourſe, if I ſhould have char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged my Memory with the Contrivance and Connexion of ſo many, and various Parts at once: and I foreſaw that all the Strength of my Mind, which ſhould be collected and united in the treating every ſingle Argument would be unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſpent in diſtracted, divided, and imperfect Efforts.</p>

Now the moſt perfect Idaea of Happineſs that the Mind of Man can frame is this, <hi>Happineſs is the ſtate of a perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the unmixt, uninterrupted, and

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this Enquiry.</note>THe Deſire of Happineſs is the firſt, moſt Powerful, and moſt Univerſal Principle of humane Actions; This moves the Prince and Peaſant, the Learned and the Idiot: Revelation and Reaſon take this for granted, all Laws both Divine, and Humane, propoſing our Happineſs as the ſole and ſufficient Motive to our Obedience.</p>
               <p>But all this while, thô all ſorts of Religion and Government do una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly conſent in the Propoſal of this one general end; yet ſo great is

the Diverſity (I may ſay Contrariety) in the Methods in which they purſue it, that it ſeems to imply the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Happineſs a matter of no leſs Uncertainty than Importance; there being neceſſarily as great a Variety in the Opinions of Men about it, as in their Lives and Actions, or in the forms of Religion and Government in the World; ſince all theſe ſeem, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the different Judgments of Men, ſo many different Paths which lead to it.</p>
               <p>Till therefore I have fix't the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Happineſs, and found out what it conſiſts in, 'tis impoſſible I ſhould live rationally: how ſhall I ſteer the Courſe of my Life aright, when I know not what Port I would make? how ſhall my Actions tend to any Wiſe or Noble purpoſes when I have no mark prefix't 'em? till then I muſt live <hi>extempore</hi> and act at Random, I muſt abandon my ſelf to Wind and Tide, to Time and Chance.</p>

               </q>
               <p>In a word, till I have fixt this Notion, and know what to aim at, Buſineſs will be but a Mechanic Drudging out of life, and Study but a vain amuſement of my Mind: whereas when all the Inclinations of Life and Soul ſhall have one Uniform bent and tendency, when every deſire of the Soul, and every action of Life ſhall be a ſtep advancing in a direct line towards Happineſs, when the vigour and activity of my Mind ſhall not be ſuſpended and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by incertainties and fluctuation, nor deluded and loſt in wandring Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Deviations, but ſhall ever car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me ſtraight forwards towards my Journey's End: then certainly all my Labours will thrive and proſper, and my progreſs will be great, thô my Motion ſhould be but feeble and ſlow: Thus Plants whoſe native vigour mounts ſtraight upwards, thô their bulk be leſs, yet their height and beauty is greater than their's whoſe

Luxuriant nouriſhment waſts it ſelf in gouty Knots, and diſtorted Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>Having conſider'd this I reſolv'd, that I could not ſpend my time more manly, and Philoſophically than in an Enquiry, what the Happineſs of Man is, and how attainable: Every Advance towards this is an acceſſion to my Life and Being; and all Travail which doth not lead me on towards this End is but ſo much of Life miſpent and loſt; what a ſillyneſs were it to load my Memory with terms and words, with numerous Inſtances of Matters of Fact, to marſhal up in Order, Lines, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, to talk of unknown Seas and diſtant Shores, to tumble over each Page in Nature's Syſteme?

If after all I have no Receipt for a troubled Mind, no Cure for diſtempered Paſſions, if I have no Principle to ſupport my Mind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſinking Fortune, or govern it in

a riſing one, if I have nothing to arm me againſt my Fears, or to diſperſe my Griefs; wou'd any one think I had ſpent my time well, or ſtock't my ſelf with uſeful Knowledge?</p>
               <p>But to find out what would make me Happier, to find out what would free my Mind from the ſlavery of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie Paſſions, what would make it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, ſteady, great and manly in all the Accidents of Life; this every Man ſees at the firſt bluſh to be a wiſe, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and ſerviceable Employment of my Reaſon.

               <p>But thô Happineſs ſhould be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject too great,<note place="margin">The Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Enquiry for the Redreſs of Humane Miſery.</note> too ambitious for a poor ſilly Mortal; yet ſure the Redreſs of thoſe Evil which oppreſs our State and Nature is ſuch an humble and modeſt Deſign as may well become the meanneſs of Man; and therefore if I could not excuſe the Confidence or Preſumption of this Enquiry by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the innate Deſire of Happineſs; yet ſure I might by urging the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thoſe Evils which infeſt Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life, which 'tis not only irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional but impoſſible ſo far to yield and ſubmit to, as not to ſtruggle to free our ſelves from 'em, or endeavour to lighten their afflicting weight, or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101160:16"/>
ſtudy to prevent 'em: This I confeſs was the firſt, and none of the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Arguments that engag'd me; I love my ſelf, and would be, if not Happy, at leaſt not miſerable, and I am neither inſenſible nor fearleſs; I know the common Portion of Man, and I cannot ſo far flatter my ſelf as not to apprehend approaching Evils, nor am I naturally ſo hard and tough as not to ſhrink and gall under the weight of them, and I ſuppoſe moſt Men are of the ſame Nature with me, and as liable as I am to all the Evils of Time and Chance; and conſequently this one Conſideration of Humane Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery ought to work very powerfully in them, and effectually oblige 'em to this Study.</p>
               <p>In this place I took a Diſtinct View, and made an Exact Survey of every particular Calamity which befalls Man, reducing 'em all under their ſeveral heads; I allow'd my ſelf the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly pleaſure of viewing the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pomp, whil'ſt I ſaw their numerous Legions marching under their diſtinct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101160:16"/>
fatal, dreadful weapons: but beſides that this would have made too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious an Interruption in the thread of my Diſcourſe: I will deal freely with the World, I had in private drawn as exact and lively a Portraicture of Humane Miſery, as I could, I had left no ſhade, no feature wanting as I thought: but when I had finiſhed it, obſerving it exactly from head to foot, I found my own Sins and Follies made up the ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt and moſt frightful Parts of it: and therefore I thought it not freedom but impudence to expoſe to open view all the Deformities of the Soul, when natural Modeſty guides the <hi>Painter</hi>'s hand to draw a covering over the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comley Parts of the Body.</p>
               <p>However ſuch a general Survey of Humane Miſery as may ſerve to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our Concern, and quicken and inflame our Induſtry, will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper or unneceſſary in this place: A rude Draught or naked Scheme of the general heads of thoſe Evils, to which the Life of Man is expos'd, will preſent us with a very formidable hoſt of Plagues and Miſchiefs.

and what is worſe than this, numerous are the Evils which we ſuffer not only in thoſe things which we call our's, but alſo in thoſe we our ſelves confeſs not to be our's; ſuch are reſtleſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, wakeful and laborious Purſuit, tame digeſtion of the Neglect, Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Inſolence and Inſincerity of thoſe we depend upon and addreſs to; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous Repulſes, Vexatious diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After all this, all theſe Evils are to be reckon'd double, for we are liable to 'em not only in our ſelves, but in our Friends and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; and then we muſt double 'em almoſt all again, for we ſuffer 'em in Reality or in Fancy and Imagination, we ſuffer 'em when preſent and when future too: for as if the Evil of the Day were not ſufficient for it, we ſearch the dark and unknown Regions of future time, that we may find out what may make us miſerable; and we frequently torture our ſelves with Idle not Prophetic fears: we often ſuffer the want, the pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we ſhall never feel; and our own ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, deſpondent, melancholy Minds

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101160:20"/>
theſe Men are contradictions to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Philoſophy to all true Reaſon; for notwithſtanding this affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted debaſing of humane Nature, the tranſports of theſe Voluptuaries are as bold and ambitious as thoſe of the haughtieſt <hi>Stoic,</hi> and 'tis no ſtrange thing to hear an <hi>Epicurean</hi> boaſt of a Parity or Equality with his <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the point of Happineſs or Pleaſure. But to anſwer the Objection in a word, be the Nature of Mankind what it will, I do readily confeſs, that it were, if not a ſinful, yet a vain ambition for Man to affect any other Happineſs than what was ſuitable to his Nature; for it were to purſue what he were not capable of, it were like the folly of <hi>Semele</hi> in the Poet when ſhe deſir'd that ſhe might be entertain'd by <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> not only with the Paſſion of a Lover, but the Glory and Majeſty of a God, and ſo being fatally ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in her wiſh, ſhe periſhed in the Embraces ſhe had ſo proudly begg'd; this therefore we readily grant, Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is a ſtate of Pleaſure, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is the Reſult of the proportion and

agreeableneſs of the Object to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or appetite; ſo that he that aſpires to a ſtate of Happineſs that infinitely exceeds his nature, fooliſhly doats on Contradictions, and affects a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs devoid of Pleaſure: or which is all one, covets a Pleaſure which he cannot enjoy: This being yielded to on the one hand, that we ought to purſue no other ſtate of Happineſs than what ſuits and fits our Capacities; they ought as readily to yield on the other hand if they will ſuppoſe God the Creator of Man, and concern'd in his Actions (as theſe ſeem to do) that he does not only allow of, but delight in all the Endeavours of Man after ſuch a ſtate: thoſe Faculties and Capacities he endows us with being the faireſt Declarations of his Will what he deſigns us for: the ſole Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty therefore that remains will be this, what the Nature of Man is? what the Dignity and Excellency of the Rational Soul? which ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed in its place.</p>

Author of it, but that they may with the greater Security contemn the one, and deprave the other by ſluggiſh Luxury and unbridled Luſt.

Therefore as to the former part of the Objection, were it but once truly determin'd what were to be underſtood by <hi>Nature,</hi> this Objection would vaniſh: I think our Souls within us may be juſtly ſuppos'd to conſtitute a part of our Nature as well as our Bodies; and therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be content that the Body, much leſs vicious habits (commonly call'd indeed a ſecond Nature) ſhould uſurp the Name and Authority of Nature; nor conſequently can I be content to allow of the mere ſenſual Appetites of the Body, much leſs the Dictates of vicious habits for the Laws of Nature: The Body indeed is an Eſſential part of our Nature, but then it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred

'tis not the governing part; and therefore it's Inſtinct cannot Arrogate to it ſelf the Authority of a Law.

As to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of this Objection; By <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> is commonly mean't thoſe Principles and Practices which are generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and faſhionable in the place we live; I have a juſt Veneration for whatever is the ſenſe of Mankind, but I think their ſuffrage is not to be taken by number, but by weight: nor are we to follow the Opinion or Example

of the moſt, but of the beſt, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is it poſſible to underſtand what is the ſenſe of Mankind in this point; for we have Cuſtom againſt Cuſtom, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Nation, and Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Religion.</p>
                  <p>It ought farther to be conſider'd, That Principles taken upon truſt have ſeldom an equal influence upon us, with thoſe which we take up upon ſtrict Examination and mature Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: that men will eaſily be tempted to deſert thoſe for which they have no better Authority than the vote of a Multitude: Nor can any thing tend more to the Diſparagement of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion than this, that 'tis not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of our Judgment but our Fortune; or to the Diſhonour of any Religion than this, that 'tis Magiſterially ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded by the Authority of Laws and terrour of Force, and will not ſubmit it ſelf to the tryal of ſober Philoſophy: and ſo I take it to be a Credit to the Chriſtian Religion, that it did not force aſſent, but gain it by irreſiſtible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that tis ſo far from ſhunning the tryal of Impartial Philoſophy, that

with common Prudence, with the very Conſtitution of a rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for what uſe can be as much as fancied of Reaſon, if I ſlight its ſervice in ſo important an affair as this?</p>
                  <p>It is true, Temper Fortune and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation have <hi>de facto</hi> ſo great a ſhare in the Happineſs or Miſery of ſome kind of men eſpecially, that I muſt not yet diſmiſs this Objection till I have taken a little notice of ſuch for whoſe defence and ſervice it was at firſt found out; Theſe are,</p>

                  <p>Were the Incapacity of theſe Men great enough to juſtifie their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Reaſon and Religion, I ſhould almoſt be tempted to call them Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: but at the ſame moment I ſhould deſpiſe their Happineſs, <hi>Non ideo tamen quiſquam felicia dixerit,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, The Gay, the Gaudy, the Modiſh, the unthinking part of Mankind; theſe in their own Opinion, and truly in the Opinion of the World (moſt men being either Flatterers or Enviers of their good luck) may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Happineſs: and if their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be well founded, their way to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101160:26"/>
Happineſs is a more ready, plain, and compendious one than any that ever was or ever will be diſcover'd.</p>
                  <p>But alaſs ſhortneſs of ſight cannot paſs with me for Wit, nor an unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Confidence for Wiſdom: I have ſeen moſt of thoſe Dreams the World can preſent the gayeſt fancy with, and upon the utmoſt of my trial, I have perhaps found ſomething that could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, nothing that could ſatisfie a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul: I will not here Examine what is the Imployment, what the Pleaſure proper to a Rational Being: Nor will I now go about to ſhew, that that Mind can enjoy no ſober or laſting Peace, much leſs Pleaſure, which is engag'd in ſuch a Method of life as it cannot give a good account of, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally juſtifie to it ſelf; both which Conſiderations would be plain Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this gay Objection: 'tis enough in this place to ſay that this, ſort of life is repugnant to thoſe Principles which Religion reveals, which Reaſon ſeems readily to embrace, and which are back't by all the Authority which the unanimous Approbation of the wiſeſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101160:27"/>
and beſt part of Mankind can give 'em. It behoves us therefore not to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our ſelves to this kind of life, till we have narrowly diſcus't and try'd theſe Principles; for if they ſhould prove true, then will this ſenſual care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs life betray us to a miſerable Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: and thô they ſhould be falſe, yet till we are upon Rational Grounds convinc'd that they are ſo, we have little Reaſon to commit our Happineſs to ſo great a hazard, where the Odds are very great againſt us that we are in the wrong.</p>
                  <p>It remains notwithſtanding all theſe Objections that it behoves every man to purſue his Happineſs by a Rational Enquiry after it, neither undervaluing Humane Nature or its Happineſs, nor giving up himſelf to the guidance of the bruitiſh and blind part of him, but ſeriouſly and thorowly to Examine whatever End be propos'd to him as his Happineſs, or whatever Method be propos'd to him as the way to it; but when we have blown off theſe not formidable Objections againſt this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, but looſe and wanton Excuſes

But as in that great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Complexion, Feature, Shape and Motion, and in that great diverſity of Capacities and Endowments which we behold in men, there is yet one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nature wherein they all agree,

whereby they are conſtituted Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the ſame Species: juſt ſuch accidental Varieties may the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man be capable of, and yet the Life and Being, the Soul and Subſtance of Happineſs may be one and the ſame, and conſequently may be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under general Rules. And if this anſwer were not ſufficient, it would not be abſurd to ſay, that Happineſs like Beauty may put on various Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and yet be ſtill charming and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful in each, or that this Bread like that of Heaven (for ſo the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins tell us of Manna) has that in it which gratifies every Palate; there are Soveraign and unallay'd Bleſſings, ſuch as Liſe, and Perfection, and Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which take with every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and are univerſally welcom'd to all the Sons of men.

Wits will renounce the Deſires or Hopes of a Cure, becauſe Phyſicians differ in their Opinions about the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of it: the ſtudy of Philoſophy has never been utterly forſaken, thô that of one age baffle and o'rethrow that of another, and yet even this again ſtands rather upon the weakneſs and obſcurity of the former, than its own Strength or Evidence. The <hi>Academics</hi> do not ſeem to have entertain'd ſo groſs an abſurdity as ſome have fancy'd, when they taught that Wiſdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the ſearch of Truth, even at the ſame time when they believ'd that it could not be fully found out: for where Certainty cannot be had, it is not unreaſonable to follow the faireſt probabilities. And if this were ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally practiſed in any Study, certainly much more in that of Happineſs; ſince the Neceſſity of this Study above any other doth more indiſpenſibly oblige us to it; for all Labour and Learning that promotes not the great End of Happineſs is to no purpoſe, ſince we are ne're the better for't; for to be the better, and to be the happier for't is all one.</p>

others, the wandrings of a wanton Confidence; of others, the crooked windings of Deſigning Intereſt, and ſo on; for it may with much truth be affirm'd, that all Erroneous Philoſophy in matters Neceſſary and Fundamental, is the Reſult of ſome unworthy Luſt and Paſſion; But all theſe Matters, namely the uſe of Revelation and God's Spirit, the Vanity of all Objections form'd againſt Religion from Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about it, the Difficulties the Heathens were to encounter in their Enquiries after Happineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be more fully treated of in their proper places.</p>
                  <p>Thus I think I have ſufficiently evinc'd the Importance and Neceſſity of an Enquiry after Happineſs, ſince 'tis impoſſible to ſteer the Courſe of Life aright without a clear Knowledge of that which ought to be the End, the Centre of all our Deſires and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that is, Happineſs: without this 'tis not only impoſſible to be happy, but what ought ſeriouſly to be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, impoſſible not to be miſerable: nor let us ever ſo far diſparage and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value

Humane Nature or diſhonour the Author of it, as ever once to fancy, that Happineſs is too great for us, or we too little for it; or that God ſhould diſallow as a Sacrilegious Ambition the moſt rational attempts of a rational Creature, I mean thoſe of becoming Happy: ſince we ſeek no other Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than what the Make and Frame of Nature, and conſequently the God of Nature app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The Poſſibility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> prov'd; becauſe ſome are Happier than others; becauſe there is Good and Evil in the World. Evils not more than Goods in the World. The Efficacy of Evil not greater than that of Good. Man's Good or Evil depends upon himſelf. §. Objections anſwer'd. God not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in Humane Miſery.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101160:32"/>
The Objection from Fate anſwer'd. Several Notions of Fate. No inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable Neceſſity in Humane Affairs or Actions, at leaſt no Fate over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling the Mind of Man. No Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Happineſs from Nature. Against Moral Incapacity. Againſt penal Incapacity. Inſtances of Men actually Happy in this Life.

               </argument>
               <p>IT is apparent from the former Chapter, that the purſuit and ſearch after Happineſs is a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Undertaking, an Imployment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Nature and State of Man: there remains only one Objection, which if true, were ſufficient to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Endeavours, and chill the heat of the moſt Vertuous and Reſolv'd Ambition.

                  <hi>Few and Evil have the Days of the Years of my life been.</hi> But it moves me not ſo much to hear this from the mouth of a Shepherd who from his Youth led a laborious and unſetled life: But when I read the mournful Poems of <hi>Job,</hi> the Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and Melancholy of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Men no leſs Eminent for Wiſdom and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy than for their Worldly Glory and Proſperity; when I read 'em bewailing the Lot of Mankind, unable to reflect upon it without a mixture of Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Contempt and Womaniſh Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, I cannot but acknowledge that I am ſhrewdly tempted to deſpair of Happineſs as of ſomething too great and Divine to make its abode upon Earth, and to look upon all the fine Diſcourſes that Men make of it only as ſo many flights of a bold fancy.

ſum of all is this, A good Man has the beſt Title to the Bleſſings of this life, and the Glories of another, he enjoys this World with as great Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as Wiſdom and Moderation, and has an aſſur'd hope of a far better when he quits this; the Anticipations of which by Faith, Love, and Hope, do at once facilitate and confirm his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over all unworthy Luſts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him with unexpreſſible Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>For this Reaſon, I do in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcourſe of Happineſs without that immediate regard to another life, which might be expected: not judging my ſelf oblig'd either to prove the Certainty of it, or to demonſtrate the Reaſonableneſs of embracing Miſery during the ſpace of this ſhort life, in Expectation of that Perfect and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs which is promiſed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; ſince I ſaw well enough that in the ordinary courſe of Providence, the Happineſs of this life and the other, were not incompatible: but on the Contrary, that that wherein the Life and Being of true Happineſs in this

And I think the Death of Martyrs and Confeſſors, is rather a great Confirmation than Confutation of this Opinion: teaching us plainly that in deſpight of all Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, 'tis not only poſſible to live, but to dy Happily; which laſt is no ſmall acceſſion to Temporal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

From this Diſtinction of the Nature and Effect of Evils we may infer this Comfortable Concluſion; That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can make man wholly, truly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable but himſelf; Nothing can op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs him by the weight of Moral Evils, but his own Choice, for nothing can compel or neceſſitate him to be wicked; the ſtroaks, the wounds of natural Evils (ſo I will call all the reſt diſtinct from moral and owing their Being to the Revolutions of time and Chance and Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are faint and ſlight; the Mind of Man ought not to ſuffer it ſelf to be too deeply and ſenſibly affected by them: it is the work of Reaſon and Religion to fortifie the Mind againſt the Impreſſions of theſe Evils: and truly that Mind that

Falſhood under a diſguiſe of Friendſhip could never have abus'd our Confidence, by betraying our Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, or forſaking us in Affliction, had not our own folly and ſelf-conceit firſt betray'd us, expoſing us a naked prey to Flattery and Treachery: The Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Neglect of great Men could never wound us, the hollow deceitful Profeſſions of thoſe above us could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Finally Death it ſelf muſt derive its terrors from the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Solemnities we dreſs it in, from the darkneſs and horrours of our deluded Imaginations; or elſe it would prove but a contemptible Bugbear, a very inconſiderable Evil, or none <hi>at All.</hi> Thus 'tis Evident, that if we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Evils into Natural and Moral, we ſhall have little reaſon to think the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Evil ſo Malignant and Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſince 'tis in our own Power to avoid moral Evils, and natural ones ſtrike but half way, they wound not the Soul that is arm'd and guarded with Reaſon and Religion.

It will now be time to conſider what impreſſions they do generally make upon us, what their real Effect commonly is, how men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally are mov'd and affected by them. 'Tis true there are ſome that mix Heaven and Earth upon every ſlight occaſion, that will receive Good but no Evil at the hand of God, moſt inſenſible of Bleſſing, but extremely tender and ſenſible of any Evil; but this ſpeaks not the Nature of Evil, but of the Man; it ſpeaks him ingrateful, but not the Evil intolerable. Nor is humane Nature to be meaſur'd by this whining querulous humour of a few, but by the ſenſe and temper of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality; amongſt whom 'tis eaſie to obſerve, how Inſtinct teaches us to elude the ſtroak and force of Evil, Nature opens its Arms and enlarges it ſelf to receive good, and all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the mind greedily ſtrive to ſhare

that ſomething beyond the Grave did relate to them, and that they did not utterly periſh and dye. And if this kind as well as obſtinate hope do in ſome meaſure break the force of the greateſt Evil that is Death; we cannot but expect that it ſhould be highly ſerviceable to Man in moving him to deſpiſe, or enabling him to vanquiſh leſs Evils; hence 'tis that no examples of the Inconſtancy or Change of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, of the incertainty of Royal or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular favour, no Inſtances of ſlighted Service, deluded Hope, ſudden Death, or any thing of this kind are ſufficient to diſcourage the attempts, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of Mankind after worldly things, we boldly adventure upon thoſe Seas which we ſee ſcatter'd o're with nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Wrecks, and confidently purſue thoſe Paths where we every moment meet with the ominous Ruines of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed hope, and fruitleſs drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and baffled preſumption.

After all it doth therefore manifeſtly appear that as the Number of Evils is not greater than that of Goods, ſo neither is the Vigour and Energy of the one ſo much greater than that of the other, that a little Evil ſhould out-weigh a great deal of Good, that a little Evil ſhould contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more to a man's Miſery, than a great deal of Good to his Happineſs There remains nothing further to be examin'd, but</p>

                  <p>By a Recapitulation of all that has been hitherto diſcours'd, it may eaſily appear how far I have advanc'd in the proof of that Aſſertion I undertook to make Good, namely, that Happineſs may be attain'd in this World; I have ſhew'd that Religion doth no way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct our preſent Happineſs, that Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mortification which it enjoyns, not forbidding us to allow the World a proper place in our Eſteem, but to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value it, but to doat upon it; not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding us the Enjoyment, but abuſe of the things of this World. No man therefore will ever be able to prove that this Doctrine is injurious to our Happineſs, till he be able to convince us that 'tis indiſpenſibly neceſſary to our Happineſs to doat upon theſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things, and to be as irrational and intemperate in our Enjoyment of 'em as our Paſſion for 'em: which he can never go about to do, without contradicting not only reveal'd Truth, but alſo the Univerſal Reaſon and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:101160:61"/>
of Mankind. I have in the next place ſhew'd, that ſome are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than others, or at leaſt leſs miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, That this Diſtinction of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or ſtate of Men is to be imputed to the Vertues of ſome, and the Vices of others. I have ſhew'd in the laſt place that the World abounds with good things, that there is no Appetite nor Capacity of Man that may not find Objects proper and agreeable, and ſuch as in a great meaſure may delight and ſatisfie; and that Man is endow'd with ſuch a variety of faculties, and ſenſes, that there is ſcarce any thing in all the variety of Beings the World contains, which he is not capable of enjoying. From whence it clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That Man may be happy in the Enjoyment of theſe good things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Evil of life ſour and imbitter the Good, or the attainment of the Good be out of the Power of Man, to remove all ſuſpicion of both which, I diſcours'd ſomething thô briefly of the Nature of Evil, and the Nature of Man, evincing plainly the Impotence and Feebleneſs of the one, and the Strength
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101160:61"/>
and Preparations of the other; and for the Cloſe of all, I have endeavour'd to make it manifeſt that Good and Evil are not ſo much the Reſult of Time or Chance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Wiſdom and Folly. From all which the Concluſion that naturally ariſes is this; That if Man be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble 'tis his own fault, or which is all one, a Man may be happy if he will, which was the thing to be prov'd. Let us try now by a Cloſe Application of all that has been ſaid to the Wants and Neceſſities of Mankind, what the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, what the Conviction, what the real uſe and force of this Diſcourſe is. I am unhappy, I am miſerable; whoe're thou art that ſay'ſt ſo, thou muſt needs mean one of theſe two things. Thou do'ſt enjoy no good or art oppreſt with Evil: If the latter, I demand what Evil? ſpeak out; ſpeak plainly. There are three ſorts of Evils; the Evils of the Mind, the Evils of the Body, the Evils of Fortune. Which of thoſe art thou oppreſt by? The Evils of the Mind? Theſe are either ſinful Paſſions, or what is the Effect of them,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101160:62"/>
guilty Fears: Nothing can compel thee to be wicked, ceaſe to be wicked, and thou wilt ceaſe to fear. The Evils of the Body? they are generally the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of unruly Paſſions and a diſorderly Life; and where they are not, the Pleaſures of the Mind will outweigh the Pains of the Body. The Evils of Fortune? 'tis in thy Power, whether theſe ſhall be really Evils, or no; they befall thy Poſſeſſions not thee; the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and vicious Mind only ſuffers in theſe, the Wiſe and Vertuous one is much above them; 'tis therefore thy own fault if thou be oppreſſed with Evil. But wilt thou ſay the former? I enjoy no Good, no ſatisfactory Good. why? is there no Good to be enjoy'd? I have already prov'd the contrary; and if I had not, how eaſie were it here to do it? there's Truth to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thy Underſtanding; Moral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to delight thy Will; Variety of Objects to treat thy ſenſes, the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the viſible and inviſible World to be enjoy'd by thee: why then do'ſt thou defer to live? why do'ſt thou not begin to enjoy? here
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101160:62"/>
'tis Evident that thou muſt be forc't to ſay one of theſe Two things, either That thou art not capable of Enjoying theſe Bleſſings, or that they are out of thy Reach, out of thy Power: to ſay thou art not capable of 'em is to re-renounce the faculties of thy Soul and the ſenſes of thy Body; to ſay they are out of thy Reach, is in Effect to ſay that Vertue and Vice, Wiſdom and Folly are all one; or which is every jot as abſur'd, that thou art wicked and ſottiſh, and can'ſt not help it. And this is that indeed which in Effect, all do ſay that accuſe Fortune, or Fate, or Nature, or any thing but themſelves as the Cauſes of their Miſery: and yet as abſur'd as this is, it muſt be now examin'd, becauſe the Minds of Men are perverted and diſcourag'd by ſuch Notions, I will proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Third thing propos'd.

                     <hi>SECT. III.</hi> To anſwer the Objections againſt the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of Happineſs.</head>
                  <p>THoſe who deny the Poſſibility of attaining Happineſs in this Life, are of two ſorts; Firſt, ſuch who argue from Experience and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation (without troubling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to aſſign any Reaſon or Cauſe of what they affirm) No man ever has been Happy; and therefore No man can: This has in part been already anſwer'd, and ſhall more fully in the cloſe of this Chapter. Secondly, Such who aſſign a Cauſe or Reaſon, why ſome are miſerable and cannot poſſibly be otherwiſe. The Number of theſe, if men would talk Coherently, if they would be firm, and ſteady to their Principles, would be very ſmall: for as the Belief of a God, the Creator and Governor of the World, deſtroys Fate; ſo doth the Denial of a God deſtroy the Liberty of the Mind of Man, and render all its motion as Determinate
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101160:63"/>
and Neceſſary, as that of Fire, or Air, or any inanimate Body whatever: and therefore (as it were fit) the Atheiſt only ſhould oppoſe this Propoſition, and he who has excluded God out of the World, ſhould exclude Happineſs too: for if whatever be not voluntary (I ſpeak of Humane Miſery) be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and unavoidabe, and whatever be ſo, be Fatal, as needs it muſt, for I am not able to diſtinguiſh between a fatal Event, and one that is Neceſſary and unavoidable: Then it naturally follows, that the Atheiſt only ſhould deny the poſſibility of attaining Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, as he who only aſſerts Fate. But the Reaſonings of many men are wild and inconſiſtent, and therefore ſome who widely differ in their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, do yet conclude and center in one common Errour; and thus it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens here, Theiſts as well as Atheiſts endeavouring to introduce Fate into the World, and conſequently to make the miſery of ſuch as are miſerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary, fatal, and unavoidable: 'tis true, he that affirms ſome men to be unavoidably miſerable, doth not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101160:64"/>
deny, that others may be Happy; but he doth in Effect diſcourage all who are not already Happy, from endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to be ſo: and therefore muſt here be oppos'd by me.</p>
                  <p>Now 'tis true that I might this way with one ſtroke cut off all Objections at once; for he that baffles the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Fate, leaves every man in a Capacity of Happineſs, and proves his miſery voluntary; for that Choice which Man makes, being not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily or fatally determin'd to it, is a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary one; and this were a very eaſie Task. For firſt, I do not know, that there were ever any in the World (a few only excepted) ſo addicted to maintain an Univerſal Fate, as that they did not exempt the Mind of Man from its Soveraignty and Dominion (of which anon) and in the ſecond place, if any at this Day do not, as a Philoſopher once prov'd, motion by walking; ſo were it as eaſie and ready a way to prove the Liberty of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by ſome free Choice or other: But when one is oblig'd to anſwer Objections, that Method muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101160:64"/>
not which the Nature of things invites to, but the manner of Mens propoſing their Opinions compels to; Therefore becauſe men do generally impute their Miſery to either God, Fortune, Fate, or their own Incapacity of Happineſs; I will ſpeak diſtinctly to each of theſe. And,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I'le endeavour to ſhew that God is not the Cauſe of any man's Miſery, to which purpoſe I muſt aſſert and vindicate the infinite Goodneſs of God, and his love of Mankind: If what <hi>Epictetus</hi> ſaid with reſpect to many Gods had been ſpoke, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to one, nothing had ever been ſaid with more exact truth, or a better pois'd judgment,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>. The firſt and Chief thing in Religion is to have Rational and true Notions of God, it being otherwiſe impoſſible that Religion ſhould ſerve the great Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of God's Glory, and Man's Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: for falſe and unworthy No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of him muſt needs bereave God of the Honour and Worſhip due to him
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101160:65"/>
from his Creatures, by alienating the Minds of Men from him, and betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em into Superſtition, Idolatry or Atheiſm: and thus that Religion which was deſign'd to glorifie God by the manifeſtation and acknowledgment of his Divine Excellencies and Perfections, and to advance Man into a ſtate of Bleſſedneſs, by influencing his life, and filling his Mind with Security and Chearfulneſs, ſhall be perverted to Ends directly contrary, and prove inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to Diſhonour God and render Man miſerable. The truth of this has been too too Evident in thoſe viſible Effects the Ignorance, or miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Divine Nature produc't amongſt the Gentils, the want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving aright his Omnipotence and Immenſity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> joyn'd with the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Neceſſities of Mankind did bring forth, or at leaſt confirm Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm; Groundleſs Apprehenſions of Cruelty in God brought forth Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and the Abſurdities of Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm and Superſtition gave Being to Atheiſm: and at this Day there are many miſchiefs which I muſt impute
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101160:65"/>
either to falſe Notions of God, or want of juſt Conſideration of the true Ones, or at leaſt to not arguing clearly and truly from 'em. For from one of theſe Reaſons it proceeds, that the Worſhip of ſome Men is ſo ſlight, empty and trifling; the Religion of others ſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and uncomfortable, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Superſtitious; and I am afraid there is too much of Atheiſtical looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſenſual, carnal Preſumption and wretchleſs Deſpair, and many other Evils owing to the ſame Cauſe: had Men worthy Notions of God, how were it poſſible they ſhould ever fancy, that God would accept the Sincerity and Devotion of a Communicant ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but not kneeling? after Supper, but not in the Morning? that the whiteneſs of the Garment would pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and unhallow the Spiritual Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Prayer and Praiſes? and ſuch like. Would not a right Notion of God eaſily convince ſuch a weak and ſcrupulous trifler, That God were not to be pleas'd but by ſincere and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, nor to be diſpleas'd but by voluntary
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101160:66"/>
wickedneſs? All things elſe weighing nothing in the Ballance of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and not deſerving the Notice or Regard of the Governour of the World: and thô ſuch a one ſhould ſuppoſe his ſcruples warranted by Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and conſequently becauſe the Soveraignty of God renders all his Commandments indiſputably Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative and binding, he ſhould therefore think himſelf as indiſpenſibly oblig'd to reject theſe things, as to ſhun a Sin; yet even here a right Underſtanding of the Divine Nature, would ſoon inſtruct him how to diſtinguiſh the Divine Commands, and teach him that thoſe which did enjoyn Holineſs and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs were the ſtanding and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws of the Divine Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that thoſe which did enjoyn Duties ſubſervient to that End were of an Inferiour Nature, and did bind in proportion to their Neceſſity and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; that ſuch as did enjoyn or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid things of a more remote and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Nature, Circumſtantial, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were merely Poſitive and Arbitrary, Temporary and mutable,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101160:66"/>
and the interpoſing Neceſſity of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Duties is at any time ſufficient to ſuperſede their Obligation. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to other Effects of miſ conceptions of the Divine Nature, how were it poſſible that any one who rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the unſpeakable goodneſs of God ſhould, after he had done all he could, be tormented with doubtful Fears and Jealouſies concerning his ſtate, nay ſometimes with a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dread of God, as if he were a hard Maſter and impoſſible to be pleas'd? or how could ſuch a perſwaſion as this, That one were Damn'd from Eternity, and that neither Prayers, nor Tears, nor Induſtry could ever reverſe the fatal Sentence, find any Entertainment in that Man who were poſſeſſed with a true ſenſe and firm belief of the boundleſs love which God has for all his Rational Creatures?</p>
                  <p>It is evident therefore of what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance 'tis to propagate and ſettle in the Minds of Men a right Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Divine Nature; and of all the Attributes of God, there are none that have a more immediate and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful

is a much ſlighter Objection; for till it can appear, that Poverty is an Enemy to Vertue, or that Wealth which is the Inſtrument of Luxury, and the Nurſe of Sloth and Wantonneſs, is abſolutely neceſſary to Man's Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it will weigh but very little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo many Demonſtrations of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love, that he has not heap'd upon all Nations ſo many Temporal Bleſſings as might put 'em into a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of being Lazy, Wanton and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent.</p>
                  <p>Now give me leave to make a ſtand, and like a Traveller when he has gain'd an Aſcent, look back upon the way I have gone, and ſee how much of my Journey I have diſpatch't: My Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking was to demonſtrate the Love of God to Mankind; thus far I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd towards this with undeniable Evidence; I have proved, That Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs, Malignity and Cruelty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not belong to God, becauſe this were inconſiſtent with the Perfection of his Nature, or the Happineſs of his State: nor can it rationally be ſuppos'd, that the ſame Properties ſhould belong to

thoſe Evil Spirits which for a long time deluded the World, and that God who has done ſo much to deſtroy that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Darkneſs, and reſcuing Man, to reſtore him to a Capacity of Happineſs and Glory: how could it be, that God ſhould have done ſo much, as it is apparent he has, in the Contexture of our Nature, and the Contrivance of our ſtate, to make us in Love with Goodneſs, and irreconcileably Enemies to Tyranny, Cruelty, Arbitrary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if he himſelf were paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, furious, and Arbitrary in his Cruelties?

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101160:79"/>
bounds of our Imagination be the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent of the Almighty's Power. However 'tis not difficult ſo to explain this Aſſiſtance of God in ſuch ſort as may free it from the leaſt ſuſpicion of Implying a Contradiction: For <hi>Firſt,</hi> as to his Direction and Conduct of Temporal Events, how eaſie will it be for us to Conceive this poſſible to God, if we conſider, Firſt, That God can form what Impreſſions he pleaſes in the Minds of Men, and inſpire 'em with what Affections he ſhall think moſt ſerviceable to his Deſigns? for there is not the leaſt pretext or colour to imagine that the Soul is any more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the Soveraignty of God than the Body: or that God cannot do that which the Great, or the Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or the Eloquent, nay the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular and Ambitious, do ſeldom fail to do, raiſe what Paſſions he pleaſes in the Mind of Man. Or if we conſider Secondly, That the Power and Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Nature is wholly in his hands, that Life or Death, Plenty or Poverty, every thing depends upon his Will; for the Winds and Seas, Earth and Air,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101160:80"/>
Fire, Hail and Vapour obey his Voice, and are all of 'em, as often as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Inſtruments and Executioners of his Will: he that ſtills the Ragings of the Multitude, and becalms the Paſſions of the Mighty; he at whoſe Command, new Creatures enter upon the Stage of the World, and the old leave it, what is it impoſſible for him to do? nay, what is it this Almighty Governor cannot do, without moving one ſtep out of the Common Road of his Providence, without imploying any extraordinary Inſtrument, or exerting any Act of extraordinary Power? for what Secular Intereſt can there be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd whoſe Succeſs or Diſappointment depends not upon ſome or other of theſe Natural Cauſes? And yet we muſt acknowledge further, Thirdly, That the Almighty has not prefixt or ſet himſelf ſuch immutable, inalterable Laws, but that he has reſerv'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Prerogative of ſuſpending or over-ruling 'em when he pleaſes, I mean with reſpect to the Motions of Natural Bodies, or Revolutions of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Affairs; and if ſuch an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101160:80"/>
of Divine Power cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to be other than a Miracle, I muſt confeſs, I do not look upon one Age only, but every Age an Age of Miracles; Nay, I believe ſuch as theſe wrought every Day for the Protection or Relief of thoſe who depend upon this Governor of the World; for I know not to what purpoſe I ſhould, like <hi>Jonah</hi> or his Mariners, call upon God in a Storm, if it were never to be laid, till it had naturally ſpent its force and fury: I know not, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I ſhould implore the Almighty's direction upon all my Deliberations in perplex't and intangled Affairs, if I could expect no other Light than what my Labouring Mind could give it ſelf: I know not why I ſhould addreſs my ſelf to God in the Pains and Danger of an inſupportable Diſeaſe, if the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines will be the ſame, and their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue the ſame, if the Feaver will abate, and its flames be extinguiſh't or extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh life in the ſame degree and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if I Pray or if I do not. All theſe ways of Divine Providence are very plain and intelligible, and therefore

'tis manifeſt that we may without any abſurdity aſcribe to God ſuch a Super-intendency and Direction over Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Affairs, as may render the iſſue of 'em moſt ſerviceable to the true inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of thoſe that Worſhip him.</p>

that the Order, Beauty, and greatneſs of the Creation, the fixt and conſtant Returns of fruitful Seaſons, <hi>the filling men's hearts with food and gladneſs,</hi> were the only Teſtimonies which God gave the Gentiles of himſelf and his Care for Mankind: when I read that Angels are the miniſtring Spirits of God; when I read in <hi>Daniel</hi> of the Princes of <hi>Grecia</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> and find that Provinces were committed to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels as the Vice-Roys and Lieutenants of God, I cannot think, that theſe Devout and Charitable Spirits did with leſs Zeal in their Provinces labour to promote the Honor of God, and the Good of Man, than Evil Spirits did the Diſhonor of the one and the Ruine of the other: and unleſs the frequent Appearances of Angels in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning had poſſeſs'd Men's Minds with a firm perſwaſion that there was a conſtant Commerce maintain'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven and Earth; and that Spirits very frequently did viſibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themſelves in the Protection and Aſſiſtance of Men; I cannot as much as Imagine, what foundation there could

be for the numerous Impoſtures of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or upon what ground the Cuſtom of putting themſelves under the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of ſome Tutelary Spirit, could ſo generally have prevail'd in the Pagan World: without this Suppoſition the Poetry of <hi>Homer</hi> had been ſo far from being entertain'd as Sacred and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd, that it had been univerſally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd and diſlik't as an idle Rapſody of un-natural, incredible and fulſome Characters of their Gods: how could any Man, who had never heard of the Appearances of Spirits, nay who could not conceive any other Notion of ſuch Fancies than as ſomething abſurd and impoſſible, ever digeſt the groſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of a Poet bringing in a God upon the Stage at every turn? I do not therefore doubt, but that the Gentile World received very many good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Advantages from good Angels, as well as ſuffer'd many Miſchiefs from Evil ones: and I think I might with good probability believe that every good Heathen as well as <hi>Socrates</hi> had the Aſſiſtance of a good Spirit very frequently.</p>

all this by Chance, for mere Arbitrary Motion is blind and unguided; ſuch a one ſeems to me as uncapable as he is unworthy of Inſtruction: I can as ſoon believe Lightning and Thunder, Wind and Storm a God, as believe him to be a mere Arbitrary Being: The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens believ'd a God, <hi>Proteus</hi> that could turn himſelf into all ſhapes; but theſe Men believe what is infinitely more abſurd, a God, not of various and uncertain ſhapes only, but alſo of an unfixt, uncertain, indetermin'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for the Will muſt always be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and conſonant to the Nature of that Being whoſe Will it is: thus Liberty and Indetermination of Will in Man proceeds from ſome contrariety in the Principles which Conſtitute him; unſteady Judgment produces unſteady Will, and bruitiſh Nature bruitiſh Will or Inclination.

Alas, thus not the mean only, but almoſt all talk, from the Porter to the Prince, the Circumſtances of one are too ſtrait, too narrow; of another too full of Trouble, becauſe too full of State: one complains that he is withdrawn from his great End, by the many allurements &amp; ſenſual temptations, to which his rank and quality in the World expoſes him: another that he is daily fretted and indiſpoſed by the little croſs Accidents and the rugged Converſation which he is neceſſarily oblig'd to bear with: one complains of too much Buſineſs, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of too little; the hurry and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of things diſtracts the one,

                  <p>My Deſign here is to examine what real Good or Convenience there is in Wealth, how Valuable,<note place="margin">Fortune not neceſſary to Happineſs.</note> or how Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary 'tis, and that not in a Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or Sophiſtical, but ſuch a ſober and rational manner as may be Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and Convictive to every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd Mind. <hi>Firſt</hi> therefore, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> will give ſome account, whence 'tis that Men are ſo intent upon their Worldly intereſt, ſo wholly bent upon being Rich: <hi>Secondly,</hi> I will ſtate what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is meant by a Competency, and what the Advantage and Neceſſity of it is. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I will conſider what the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency of Wealth is.

                  <p>If we enquire whence 'tis, Men are ſo intent upon the World; one Reaſon is, a ſecret Infidelity, Men are deſirous

Minds, which would ſcarce be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, if there were neither? what greater Affront can we offer to the Goodneſs, the Wiſdom, the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Faithfulneſs of God, than to refuſe to repoſe the Care, the Truſt of providing for us upon him, when he not only offers, but preſſes himſelf upon the Imployment? a ſecond Cauſe why we ſo eagerly purſue Wealth, is <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality;</hi> Being Strangers to the Peace and Joy of Faith, inſenſible of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Delight of Charity, uncapable of the Extaſies, of the full Aſſurance of Hope, and in general of the Rational Pleaſure of a Philoſophical Mind; what can be expected but that both Wind and Tide ſhould drive us violently on another ſhore? I mean the whole Force and Inclination of our Nature ſhou'd impetuouſly tend towards ſenſual, worldly Pleaſures and Enjoyments; and conſequently towards Wealth, as the Neceſſary Inſtrument of Both: you grant therefore that Wealth is Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a pleaſurable life? To a pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable one 'tis, to a pleaſant one 'tis not. The ſenſual Pleaſure of a ſenſual

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:101160:105"/>

If not, then 'tis apparent how far ſerviceable Wealth is, for all that lies in its Power is to provide for us theſe Temptations: But thô a Wiſe and Vertuous Man wants no Wealth, I deny not but that he needs a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency; what this is, is the next thing to be enquir'd: for this pretext of Having what is enough, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made uſe of to juſtifie and legitimate Avarice and Ambition.</p>

A ſecond Uſe or Advantage of it is, that it helps to keep the Mind erect and free; that it puts us into a Capacity of Imploying our Reaſon, and enjoying our ſelves our own way; and leaves us not under any Temptation to unmanly Compliances, or Unchriſtian Jealouſies and Fears: for he whoſe Ambition goes not beyond this, will eaſily truſt Providence, if he believe there be any;

but what the Natural tendency of Wealth is; theſe things being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that and all other Diſcourſes of the like Nature will appear to contain very little of ſolid Truth, and to have very little of weight in them: let us come to a tryal of the Matter. If Contentment and Security were the natural Effects of Wealth, if to be Rich and to be Happy were the ſame thing, then it were not to be wondred at, that Wealth ſhould be the great Idol and Ambition of Mankind; but if it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free Men from thoſe Paſſions of the Mind, nor thoſe Diſeaſes of the Body, nor other Calamities which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter life to the Inferiour part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; what then is the Advantage of it? Let us then ſtand ſtill and conſider this, do not Hatred and Anger, Envy and Anxiety, Ambition and Luſt reign more frequently and more inſolently in the Boſom of the great and wealthy, than of the labouring Cottager? Nay, I believe upon a narrow ſearch we ſhall find that ſome Paſſions are the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of a proud and inſolent Fortune, and are not incident to a mean one,

of Nature: This is a ſecond great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Wealth, that it gives us a diſeas'd Body, and a ſhort Life: Sure then, the Rich are the Minions of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the Diſaſters which oppreſs the reſt of Mankind touch not them: On the quite contrary, all Annals are ſtuff'd with the Calamities and Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of theſe Men, rifled Wealth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated Hopes, baffled Ambition, blaſted Honours, broken dejected Power, and in a word mighty Changes are the Argument of Tragedies, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a loud and raving Paſſion: whereas the Strokes of Fortune are ſoft and gentle, when they light upon the mean, theſe are not capable of Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Alterations; their Minds are of a ſtronger Temper, their Bodies firmer, their Senſes not nice and delicate, and their little Sufferings draw not after 'em the mournful Pomp and State which attends the fall, I may call it, the Funeral of a great one: Here Envy inſults not, Malice traduces not, the petulant Multitude do not follow the Corps with confus'd Clamours and Cenſures: Nor do Acquaintance flock
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:101160:108"/>
to expreſs outwardly a Cold and formal Regard, while they feel inwardly a ſecret Joy, for that Man's fall is always unpittied whoſe Power was a barren and uſeleſs Title: But to come cloſer yet, what is it that makes up the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Humane Life? a quiet State, faithful Friends, good Wives and good Children? if we conſider it, we ſhall find the Life of Man a little beholden to Wealth in theſe Points: in all Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of time, are not the Rich the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Sufferers? the mark of Envy, the prey of Violence and Uſurpation? have they not more Enemies as well as more Friends than other Men? Friends did I ſay? they have None. They have Dependents, Flatterers, Companions and Miniſters of their Pleaſures, no Friends. Hence is it, that nothing is more Common, than for thoſe above us to wiſh for the Content, the Eaſe, and Enjoyment of thoſe below 'em: for the truth of it is, (if we proceed) Relations which are the pleaſure of Men of Middle Fortune, are the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and Incumbrance of the Rich and Great, for in all their Contracts and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:101160:109"/>
Diſpoſals, they are Servants to their Fortune, not their Inclination, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages amongſt theſe are the Matches of Eſtates, not Minds; and therefore they attend not to the Temper or the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Families they link with, nay, what is worſe, they have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their Education, or Vertue, or Wiſdom: But Money weighs all down, whatever Objections are put in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Scale; in the whole Method of their Lives, they are Slaves to their Fortune, and to their Reputation in the World, judging themſelves obliged to live, not according to their Reaſon, but their quality and the Humour, that is, the Folly of the Age, and of the Acquaintance they converſe with: Nor dare they walk by any other Maxims, in the Government of the neareſt to them, or in the Education of their Children, in all theſe things they muſt do what becomes Men of their figure in the World, not what becomes true Wiſdom. Who ſees not now that upon the whole, there is in this State or Condition of life more incumbrance and leſs true freedom; more of ſhew,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:101160:109"/>
and leſs of Enjoyment than in any other? If all this be true, you'l be apt to conclude Mankind is Mad, if Wealth neither makes us more Wiſe, nor more healthy, more free in our ſelves, nor more fortunate in our Relations, what bewitches Men into this Extravagant Dotage? what makes the World gaze upon and envy the Rich, as the only Happy Creatures? what makes us fawn upon 'em and flatter 'em, as the only Powerful and great things the World has? Something there is in it, and that's this, we ſee the outſide, the Pomp and the Pageantry of Wealth: we ſee the gilt Coaches, the rich Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the little Town of Buildings, gay Furniture, and a whole Squadron of Diſhes; and together with all this, the gaudy Trappings the Happy Man's bedight with; the Port, the Grace, the Confidence that all this gives to Ignorance and Nonſenſe: But if you'l conſider this truly, you will find all this mere Pageantry and Apparition, nothing ſolid nor real in it. As for gay Cloathing; 'tis an Advantage not worth the ſpeaking to, 'tis the Pride

From this little that has been ſaid, as it appears why Proud and Vicious Men contend for Fate; ſo does it likewiſe of what importance it is, to free Men's Minds from a perſwaſion ſo pernicious to the Intereſt of Vertue, the Peace of the Public, the Happineſs of Man, and the Honour of God.

                  <p>As to the firſt, I will not pretend to make a juſt and intelligible Collection of the Different Notions which have

been taken up of Fate, 'tis Evident from that which <hi>Grotius</hi> has done of this kind, not only how tedious and volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, but alſo how obſcure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd the Diſcourſes of Men have been on this Subject; I ſhall only therefore as far as my Memory will ſerve me, conſider their Opinions in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the Nature of this preſent Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall oblige me. Moſt Philoſophers do agree in one general Notion of Fate, that it is a Connexion or Series of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſucceſſively depending upon one another,<note place="margin">Nomeſius.</note> and producing a Neceſſary Effect or Event, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; But their Opinions concerning the firſt Ground or Original of this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Connexion or Dependence were very Various, ſome aſcribing it to <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> or Spirits, ſome to the Influence of <hi>Stars,</hi> ſome to the Circumaction or whirling about of the Heavens, ſome to an Univerſal Soul, ſome to the Force of Motion, ſome to the Contexture and Contrivance of Nature, others to Atoms, and others to God; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſince <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Mind,</hi> are the two only things into which all Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:101160:115"/>
have ultimately Reſolv'd their Search and Enquiries after the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of all things, they ought to have look't for no other Original of Fate than one of theſe two: but this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns my preſent Queſtion but very little, for if Man be over-rul'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by Fatal Laws, it matters lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle how he came to be ſo: Nor did I mention this variety of Opinions for any other Reaſon than this, that it gives us juſt Occaſion to ſuſpect Fate it ſelf as an Erroneous and ill-grounded Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for obſcurity and intricacy and multiplicity of different Notions about the ſame thing are the general Marks of Falſhood and Error: but there are two things very material to be enquir'd. <hi>Firſt,</hi> How far the Empire or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Fate was generally extended: And <hi>Secondly,</hi> what kind of Neceſſity, or what degrees of it were generally ſuppos'd to conſtitute Fate. As to the Extent of its Power, this one thing is very Remarkable, that the Heathens did Exempt the <hi>Mind</hi> of Man from its Soveraignty. <hi>Democritus</hi> indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd the Soul of Man as <hi>Neceſſarily</hi> and

                     <hi>Fatally</hi> mov'd by the Impreſſion of his Atoms as any other Natural or Irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Body, but <hi>Epicurus</hi> deſerted him in this, and following the Conduct of common Senſe &amp; Experience, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd the Liberty of the Soul of Man, and labour'd (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us) with all his might to aſſert it, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Diſtinction of Vertue and Vice, which Fate deſtroys; to ſerve this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> it was that he invented that new Motion of his Atoms, call'd by <hi>Lucretius Clinamen,</hi> ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by <hi>Tully,</hi> and how well defended by <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> I am not concern'd to Examine; for I have produc'd his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion only as an Inſtance of the clearneſs of this Truth, That the Soul of Man is not ſubject to Fate; for had not its <hi>Liberty</hi> been undeniable and ſelf-evident, the Principles of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Philoſophy had certainly oblig'd him to follow <hi>Democritus</hi> in this, as in all other Points, and to have believ'd the Soul it ſelf, o're-rul'd by Fate.

Where he that pleaſes may ſee many Inſtances of this Conditional Fate; and to come to an End, the Neceſſity of Fate in the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> if <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> repreſents it rightly, was not an inflexible, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable one, but one ſubject to Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Change, to Chance and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Impediments, being nothing elſe but that Energy or Efficacy in Natural Bodies, which the Wiſdom of Man did often prevent, the Induſtry and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of Man did often maſter, and Chance did often hinder and over-rule. By all this we ſee plainly how careful the Heathens were, that the Neceſſity of Fate might not deſtroy the Liberty of Man, how earneſtly they contended for ſuch a Fatality of Events, as might not cancel Man's Obligation to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, nor diſcourage him from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and Purſuit of Happineſs; for now to draw to a Point, and to make ſome uſe of this tedious Recital of the Pagan Notions of Fate: If we aſſert a <hi>Stoical</hi> Fate, we yet leave the Wiſe Man whatever Encouragements he can derive from the Rewards of another

life, and whatever Satisfaction he can derive from Vertue it ſelf in this. And certainly thô temporal Events were Fatal without any Connexion to, or Dependence upon the Choice and Actions of Man; yet even on this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, Vertue were eligible, as that which teaches us to enjoy Proſperity, and bear bravely that Adverſity which we could not prevent: But if with other Philoſophers we did believe, not only that the ſucceſs of another life, but even that of this too, did depend wholly upon our behaviour, and that Events were therefore only Fatal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Decrees of God which did award Happineſs to the Vertuous, and Miſery to the Wicked, are fix't and immutable; then we could not deſire more powerful Encouragements to Vertue, or more Evident proof that it is in our own Power to be Happy. If we grant the Neceſſity that makes up Fate flexible and mutable, or if we ſuſpend a fatal Event upon Conditions, as it were but reaſonable to imagine that all Evil ones are ſuſpended: there will be no Reaſon to queſtion whether

Man's Happineſs be in his own Power. If we make the Neceſſity of a Denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciative Fate, which even Wiſdom and Vertue cannot ſurmount, extend it ſelf to ſome few things; and that Fate or Fortune, which drags only Fools and Sluggards in Chains after it, more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and univerſal, which is a Notion <hi>Caelius Rodiginus</hi> ſeems to have taken from the <hi>Platonics;</hi>

And now who would expect to find that Fate in the Chriſtian which was baniſh't the Pagan World? who would expect that the Mind of Man ſhould be fetter'd and bound by a more inexorable and deplorable Neceſſity now in this Age of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> than ever it was in the thickeſt Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Paganiſm? who cou'd now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Man's Eternal ſucceſs, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, ſhould be as Fatal as ever the Stoic did believe his Temporal one in this? or who could ever imagine that Chriſtians would Charge that upon the Decrees of a Wiſe and Good God, which the Heathens out of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for him, did ever refuſe to do? for thoſe of them who made Fate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely the Decree of God did believe

that in the Diſpenſation of Evils God did wholly regard Men's Crimes and Sins; that there was no other Fate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended any Man than what he was himſelf the Author of. And they who did believe a Fatality of Events with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any dependence upon the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Man, did impute it to <hi>Matter,</hi> not to God, to the deficiency of the one, not to the <hi>Will</hi> of the other.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, ſuch a Fate is not to be found in the Scriptures, as we ſhall ſee anon; nor is it to be found in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, we may find <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin Martyr, Tertullian, Lactantius,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf, (however ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd by ſome as a Fataliſt) zealouſly Diſputing againſt the Pagan Fate: what would they have done, had there been then ſuch a Notion of Fate, as has ſince prevail'd amongſt ſome Chriſtians, which is briefly this, That the Eternal miſery of Nineteen Parts of the World, (I ſpeak modeſtly) and the Eternal Happineſs of the Twentieth, is Fatal; that the means conducing to theſe Ends are Fatal; the one being ſhut up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the invincible Neceſſity of <hi>Natural

                  <p>The ſum of thoſe Reaſons I have offer'd againſt Fate is this, If we make God the Author of it, we impiouſly Charge him with what is repugnant to his Nature, for a Good God cannot be the Cauſe of Man's Sin and Miſery: if <hi>Matter,</hi> we ridiculouſly ſuppoſe, that what is it ſelf ſenſeleſs and inanimate ſhould produce and govern a Being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with <hi>Life, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding</hi> and <hi>Liberty:</hi> If the Stars, we run again into the ſame abſurdities; for if they
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:101160:126"/>
have their fatal Influence from God, then properly ſpeaking, God is the Author, they but the Inſtrument of our Fate. If from themſelves, then our Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on, and Worſhip of God is vain, and beſides we abſurdly ſubject the Reaſon and the Liberty of the Mind of Man to the ſenſeleſs Tyranny of Atoms. If from the Conſideration of the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Fate we deſcend to examine what our Experience teaches us, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe informs us, each of 'em bears witneſs to the Soveraignty and Liberty of the Mind of Man. If we ſhou'd come in the laſt place to Examine what wou'd be the Conſequences of a Fatal <hi>Neceſſity</hi> over-ruling Man and Humane Affairs, they are ſuch as are not only groſly Contradictions in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but Fatal and Deſtructive both to the public and private Good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. 'Tis true, were the Liberty of doing Evil taken from Man, we ſhou'd have no Reaſon to complain, for then there wou'd be nothing wanting to make the ſtate of Man Happy as that of Angels, but Immortality: But to bereave Man of all Power to do good,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:101160:127"/>
to neceſſitate and compel him to be wicked, how dreadful are the Effects which muſt follow this? he that ſtains his hands in the Blood of his Soveraign or his Parent, will accuſe his Stars not himſelf; he that pollutes himſelf in the inceſtuous Embraces of a Mother or a Daughter, may defend his action as his Fate not Choice; and how readily ſhall we do all that Rage or Luſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us to, when there is an Excuſe prepar'd for all we do? for he is no more blameable who commits the Evil which he could not help, than he is worthy of Praiſe who did the Good which he could not forbear. Were it true, that whatever miſchief Man did, he were neceſſitated to do, we might with more Juſtice arraign the Stars and Atoms, than Malefactors; and all the Inſtruments of Miſchief would be every jot as Guilty and Criminal, as the Man that us'd them.

                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:101160:128"/>What plain Text of Scripture ſpeaks in this Point. And here in the firſt place we are to expect no other Fate than what depends upon God, for the Scripture makes all things derive their Original from him, and all things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him, there is but one Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and one Lord, and therefore the Creature can be ſubject to no Laws but ſuch as he Enacts; ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Fate we now lye under, muſt be imputed to the voluntary Decree of God. Is then the Eternal Ruine of Man Fatal and unavoidable? If we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Original of this Unhappy Neceſſity, it muſt be ultimately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd into the Divine Will; when God then decreed the inevitable Ruine of Man, under what Notion did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his Ruine? under that of <hi>Miſery?</hi> or that of <hi>Puniſhment?</hi> If under the Notion of Puniſhment, this Implies plainly, that we are to thank our ſelves for our Ruine: for Puniſhment is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Infliction of that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery which our Sin and Folly have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. But if under the Notion of Miſery, how can this conſiſt with the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:101160:128"/>
Infinite Goodneſs or Wiſdom of God? Alas! how Contradictory is this to Scripture? there God ſwears that he delights not in the Death of a <hi>Sinner,</hi> This Decree would ſuppoſe him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Death of the <hi>Innocent:</hi> there he is repreſented <hi>full of Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> and <hi>ſlow to wrath,</hi> even upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Provocations, this Decree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents him ſo addicted to Wrath, and Cruelty, that he made a World on purpoſe to have whereon to exerciſe it, and doth exerciſe it merely for the delight he takes in it; The Scripture finally repreſents him full of Divine love for Mankind, and not only not deſirous that they ſhould periſh, but extreamly deſirous that they ſhould be partakers of Everlaſting life; this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ſuppoſes him ſo utter an Enemy to, and hater of Mankind, that he made the far greater part to no other End, but only to make 'em miſerable. Let any unprejudiced Man judge now, whether this be not as Contradictory to Scripture as it is to Senſe: Nor is it poſſible that any unprejudic'd Man ſhould look into Holy Writ, and not
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:101160:129"/>
diſcern evidently that Man's Ruine is the Effect of Sin, not only wilfully and preſumptuouſly Committed, but alſo obſtinately and impenitently perſiſted in: and that God is ſo far from being fond of our Sufferings and Calamities, that he is ever and anon bewailing the Diſappointment of his Love, the defeat of his Grace and Mercy by our Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy and Impenitence: it is the voice of his Son, 'tis the voice of God. <hi>O Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>

But I have no Scruples in me about this Matter, I have no Fears nor Jealouſies of any ſecret Decree or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Will</hi> repugnant to his declar'd one; I am as ſure that God is <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>True</hi> as that he is Eternal or Almighty: and were he not, we could reap but very little Comfort from all his other Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes how great or glorious ſoever in themſelves. But bleſſed be God, if we proceed from examining thoſe Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of his <hi>Will,</hi> which God has made us to examine the Manner and Method of his Government as it relates to Mankind (which is another and the only way left us to judge of his Will and Decrees) we ſhall find no Inſtance in the whole Series of Divine Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which can create in us the leaſt Suſpition of lying under an Arbitrary and Tyrannical Fate; nay, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Acts of Divine Providence, we ſhall find the quite Contrary, that God ſo governs the World, that the Iſſues of things are not fatal and unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, but dependent upon our ſelves, that God is free, Man free, and the Events of things free from any inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

Neceſſity; God indeed is ever bound to do what is beſt, what is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt, and can do no otherwiſe; This is the only Fate that God is ſubject to; But a poſſibility of Different Events is no way repugnant to his Wiſdom, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or Goodneſs.

                  <p>Did Men decry and vilifie Nature, to beget in themſelves the more profound Humility, and the more wakeful and

I will therefore with good Aſſurance proceed and try whether I cannot take in and demoliſh this Fort which ſtops our way to Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>They who affirm a great part of Mankind incapable of Vertue, forget that they diſhonour God whilſt they reproach their Nature: for were it ſo, To what End could we imagine ſuch Men endow'd with Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? not to worſhip but defie their Maker? and was it for this End that they were made immortal too? had God made Man only to take his Paſtime in the World, like the <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> in the Waves, ſuch a Soul as that which moves the Fiſh of the Sea, or the Beaſts of the Earth, a Senſitive
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:101160:136"/>
Soul had been moſt proper for this End; Then might he have enjoy'd himſelf without Reluctancy, without Controul, without Remorſe, without Shame: what can be the proper work of a rational Creature, to which you allow not a Capacity of Vertue and Religion? till you can ſhew me this, I can never believe that God ſhou'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Man with a Rational and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Mind out of any other Deſign than ſuch a one as might become ſuch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Created after his own Image, which is the Practice of Holineſs and Vertue. But what ſhou'd I wonder that Men ſhou'd not be aware of their contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Reaſon when they ſeem to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of that Contradiction even to the common Senſe and Experience of Mankind which they are guilty of? To what purpoſe are there ſo many Schools of Learning and good Manners founded? To what purpoſe are there ſo many Treatiſes of the Education of Youth writ? To what purpoſe does the wakeful Parent ſtrive to inculcate the Seeds of Vertue into the Child, and train him up by a wiſe Diſcipline to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:101160:137"/>
the Practice and Cuſtom of Vertue? To what purpoſe is the propoſal of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of Laws, if either they do not raiſe thoſe Hopes and Fears they aim at, or if Hopes and Fears be altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ineffectual, if no Inſtruction no Diſcipline can mould and faſhion rough, unpoliſh't, crooked, incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Nature? Now here thô any Man might have confidence enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparage the judgment of Mankind, and attribute all the Pains they take in the Education of Youth, or the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Direction of riper Years, to Cuſtom not to right Reaſon; yet ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he wou'd not ſo far diſparage his own Obſervation and Knowledge as ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to deny the ſucceſs of theſe means; for not to inſtance in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, 'tis not unknown to any one the leaſt vers'd in the Hiſtory of the World, that there have been National Vertues as well as Vices, That there have been times wherein Learning and Religion have been as much in Faſhion and Reputation, as Wickedneſs and Barbariſm in others, ſhall we ſay, thoſe
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:101160:137"/>
Nations, thoſe times bred none of thoſe Natures, which the Objector af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms are uncapable of Vertue? Let 'em ſhew what Heavenly Influences, what miraculous Power produc'd this Change in Nature: what ſhou'd I urge the Power of vain and falſe principles, the mighty force even of irrational Cuſtoms, vanquiſhing thoſe Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are more deeply rooted, more cloſely interwove with our Blood and Spirits than any Inclination to Vice and Folly can be? Such are for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the love of Life, and the Abhorrence of Pain; and yet what a Contempt of Death is to be found even in the moſt timorous Sex, as in the <hi>Indian</hi> Women! what a Contempt of Pain even in the weakeſt Age, as in the <hi>Spartan</hi> Youth! And all this having no ſtronger Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation than irrational Cuſtom, and vain Phantaſtic Principles: why ſhou'd we therefore be unwilling to attribute to excellent Principles and vertuous Cuſtoms, bleſſed and aided by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as much Power and Vertue as we do to ſuch as theſe? if the Natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies of Man to wickedneſs can be
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:101160:138"/>
curbed, if his moſt furious and violent Paſſions can be reſtrain'd and ſtifled, then I think, it may be as reaſonably ſuppos'd that Divine Truths, Religious Diſcipline, together with the Grace of God may effect this, as any thing elſe whatever. If the preſſing Neceſſities and Perplexities of the State could change the ſoftneſs and luxury of <hi>Otho</hi> into Military Hardſhip and Courage; I know not why a rational ſenſe of the true Honour and Glory of Vertue, and of our Eternal Intereſt, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable other Conſiderations which the Goſpel lays before us Chriſtians, ſhou'd not be able to work the ſame wonders? if the Reverence of <hi>Seneca</hi> or the Senate, or any other Motive could produce a <hi>Quinquennium Neronis,</hi> could reſtrain the violent Inclinations of that wretched Man, ſo that his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for ſo many years, ſhould be as gentle and juſt as that of the moſt Gracious and Vertuous Princes, why ſhould not the Reverence of God and the Terrors of Eternity be able to awe and curb the moſt vicious Nature? This methinks ought well to be
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:101160:138"/>
weigh'd by all who aſſert Man's Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Incapacity of Vertue, they diſparage the Goſpel and reproach Grace as well as Man with Impotence and Inſufficiency; and yet both the one and the other is the Power of God, and that in order to Salvation: do you Conſider, that if you ſuppoſe Man by Nature unable to do any thing that is Good, and then deny him, and utterly debar him from God's Grace, you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Fate? for what more fatal Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity can a wretched Creature lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than <hi>Natural Impotence</hi> utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute and for ever forſaken of Divine Aſſiſtance? or if you bereave not Man of Grace, but yet bereave Grace of <hi>its Sufficiency,</hi> do you not underſtand that the fatal Neceſſity continues ſtill the ſame? there is no Change in the Man's Condition, only in this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, Grace is diſhonoured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach't as well as Nature: and this reflects very rudely too upon God, it calls the Wiſdom, the Goodneſs, the Sincerity, the Power of God into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute: 'tis inconſiſtent with the <hi>Power</hi> of God not to be able by his Spirit and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:101160:139"/>
Truth to ſubdue and over-power the Corruptions of Nature; 'tis Inconſiſtent with his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> not to be willing to aid his poor Creatures, when they call upon him; inconſiſtent with his <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi> to afford 'em ſuch aid as muſt tend to their greater miſchief not good, as Grace its ſelf wou'd, if it were only ſufficient to increaſe their Guilt, but not to ſubdue their Sin: This were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>when a Child ask't Bread to give him a Stone,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>and when he ask't Fiſh to gie him a Scorpion.</hi> 'Tis laſtly, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God to confer Grace to no purpoſe, as it was with his Goodneſs to confer it to an ill one. Theſe with many others are the abſurd Conſequences which attend the Denyal of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality</hi> or <hi>Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency</hi> of Grace; but if on the other hand, we do grant that God Almighty is ready to aſſiſt every Man who calls on him in his Endeavours after Vertue and Happineſs, and that his Aſſiſtance is ſufficient to the End, for which 'tis deſign'd; then we muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that 'tis in every Man's Power to be Good and Happy: for 'tis no
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:101160:139"/>
more than to acknowledge that Man can do what he can do, or which is all one, what God has put in his Power to do. By what a croud of Arguments might I confirm this Truth, ſufficient to bear down and even ſhame the moſt Impudent Caviller? why are not Men Good? why are they not Happy? ſhall we ſay that God doth not Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe 'em his Grace? ſhall we impute Men's miſery to God? ſhall we charge that glorious and moſt perfect Being with want of Compaſſion or Sincerity towards his poor Creatures? how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie will it be for him to appeal to the Sufferings of his Son; to the vigorous Attempts and Endeavours of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; to Heaven and Earth ſtamp't with the Impreſs of his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> on purpoſe to teach, invite and almoſt compel us to worſhip and obey him; to the various Methods of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences contriving and purſuing our Happineſs? How eaſily laſtly may he appeal for his Purgation to our own Conſciences? And theſe will tell us, as they ever do, in the Diſtreſſes of our Fortune, and the Approaches of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:101160:140"/>
and Death to what we are to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Cauſe of our Ruine: what ſhall we ſay then? doth God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe Men his Grace, the Revelation of his Truth, and the Aſſiſtances of his Spirit, but that this Grace is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for us? Alas! how eaſie were it for any of us to refute this Fancy by appealing to the ſolemn Covenant of our Baptiſm, to the Characters and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of Good Men in the Goſpel, to the Effects which our Reaſon teaches us, muſt be Natural and Inſeparable from a true Faith and Divine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? But I will chooſe to make uſe of one Argument which St. <hi>Paul</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes us with,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note>

Omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the miraculous and extraordinary Effects of Faith, I will reduce the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this Chapter to three Heads. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

                  <p>I will begin with the firſt ſort of Inſtances. It muſt be confeſſed that conſidering the Propenſions of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and the Vanity and Senſuality which the Mind naturally derives from it, and from its Commerce with the World, that 'tis a difficult thing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter Temptations naked and alone; how much more Difficult when back't and aſſiſted by Cuſtom and Faſhion, when univerſal Practice gives Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Reputation to Sin and Folly; and the poor Man is left deſtitute of the Aſſiſtance of Good Counſel and the Encouragement of good Examples to encounter not only the Difficulty with which the Reluctancies of our Nature, but alſo the Reproach with which the popularity and prevalency of Sin cloggs and imbitters Vertue: And yet behold <hi>Enoch</hi> in a World (it ſeems) given up
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:101160:141"/>
to Sin, did not only keep up in private to the Practice of deſpis'd forſaken Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; but was openly and in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner Eminent and Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary in it; and therefore was his End as extraordinary as his Life: for <hi>having obtain'd this Teſtimony that he pleas'd God he was tranſlated.</hi> This was ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Faith, he was content to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Reproach of the World, that he might obtain the Approbation of God; and deſpiſe the Honour and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of popular Vice, and faſhionable Compliances that he might gain the Kingdom wherein dwells Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Such an other Example was <hi>Noah,</hi> his Righteouſneſs, was like his Ark afterwards, rais'd above a Deluge not of Waters but Impiety; he liv'd in a World ſo wicked, that it grieved God at his heart that he had made it; in this World he was a Preacher and Example of Righteouſneſs, and his Zeal by an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> was not quench't but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled by the wickedneſs of the World he lived in: This too was owing to his Faith, he fear'd thoſe threats which that Impious World ſcoffed at, and ſo

                     <hi>by which he Condemn'd the World, and became Heir of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is by Faith.</hi> No doubt when this ſtrange Building was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>Noah</hi> was aſſaulted by all the Raillery and Contempt by all the ſhews of Wit and Reaſon, Luſt and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could furniſh an impious Age with: This Man (ſay they) has ever been Singular and Phantaſtick in the whole Method of his Converſation; there wanted but ſuch a prank as this to compleat Fancy into Madneſs: He ever dream't of Judgments, and yet we (he threatned) continued our Mirth and Pleaſure, he alone in Fears and Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties has ſuffer'd the Evils which his Melancholy Fancy created, and which are all that we ſhall ever ſee: for how long has he been Preaching dreadful things, and yet ſtill the Sun ſhines, the Heavens are fair and clear, our Feaſts and Luſts have the ſame reliſh ſtill: nor do's our Experience only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of the Falſhood, but our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Impoſſibility of this Man's Dreams; for which way ſhall the fixt

ſtate of Nature be turn'd upſide down? Whence will this univerſal Deluge come? will his God break up the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Deep? or will he open the Cataracts of Heaven? but while they thus prophanely ſcoff'd and meaſur'd the Divine Power by their deprav'd Fancies, <hi>Noah</hi> religiouſly fear'd who had a different ſenſe of the Majeſty of God and Provocation of Sin: he knew that as Mercy, ſo Wrath is with God: That as he is <hi>mighty to forgive,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Joſh. 24.</note> Theſe Inſtances are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſhew the Power of Faith in its Victory over popular Errors and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable Sins, and by Conſequence, over many Inclinations at once; for the popularity and prevalency of any Sin is a bait appropriated to our Pride and Vanity, which makes Men affect Precedence and Superiority in all things which the World admires and applauds; nor is this all, it awakens our Natural Inclinations, and Invites us to gratifie 'em, nay, it enrages Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Appetite by giving it Security and Confidence, and by working upon the Fancy and Imagination: for the Sin is always wonderfully ſet off, that is prevailing and faſhionable. I will now paſs on to the</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Second</hi> ſort of Inſtances, wherein we may behold the Strength and Power of Faith in its Victory over all Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which ſenſual Pleaſure can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us. Numerous are the Inſtances of this kind which I might produce among the Heathens, where we may find a ſenſe of the Dignity of Humane
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:101160:143"/>
Nature, of the Decency and Honour of Vertue, and a perſwaſion of the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Purity in order to a future ſtate, atchieving moſt manifeſt Victories o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all Carnal and Senſual Luſts; but I will confine my ſelf to two in this Chapter: The firſt is that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and this is a very full and Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive one. His Station being ſo near the Crown of <hi>Egypt</hi> preſented him at once with all that the World can entertain ſenſual Man with: There was Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Snare of the Soft: There was Power and Wealth the Temptations of the Ambitious Mind; (falſly call'd great) and there was Honour the airy Bait of vain unballaſted Minds. Theſe each of 'em ſingle and Stone have like <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſlain their Thouſands and ten Thouſands; and yet that it may appear that their overthrow is to be imputed to their own Negligence and Folly, behold here <hi>Moſes</hi> triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Faith over all theſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> over all the ſtrengths and forces of ſenſual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures joyn'd and united together: when he was come to years, he refus'd to be called the Son of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:101160:143"/>
and ſo deſerted a Station wherein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was bigger than his preſent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments if he had pleas'd, unleſs his future Hopes, which is the utmoſt Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of a ſtate of ſenſuality. And what is more yet, what was it he did quit all this for? what was it that he did chooſe in Exchange? was his Soul too little to fill the great place he left? No, <hi>Moſes</hi> his Courage was great as any thing, but his Meekneſs and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; was that height too open and too buſie for ſenſual Enjoyments, and ſo he retir'd like <hi>Tiberius</hi> to <hi>Capria,</hi> that he might indulge himſelf with more ſecurity and freedom, and fewer Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions? No, he chang'd Pleaſure for Affliction, Treaſure for Reproach, the Court of <hi>Egypt</hi> for the Deſart of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, he choſe rather to ſuffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon: Eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Reproach of Chriſt greater Riches than the Treaſures of</hi> Egypt. This was all the great work of Faith: his Mind was betimes poſſeſſed with a juſt Notion of, and awful Reverence for the God of his Fathers, the God of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:101160:144"/>
Heaven and Earth; and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Wants and Dangers of the <hi>Deſart,</hi> he diſcover'd the Peace and Plenty of a <hi>Canaan,</hi> and beyond both the Glories of Eternity; and therefore reaſonably concluded that it was more eligible to be the Son of God than of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter, to be the Heir of Heaven than of the Crown of <hi>Egypt;</hi> all this is intimated Verſe 26. <hi>for he had reſpect to the Recompence of the Reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will add but one Inſtance more to that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and indeed there can be but one Inſtance added that is greater, which is that of <hi>Abraham</hi> offering up <hi>Iſaac.</hi> In the former we have ſeen Faith triumphing over ſuperfluous and unneceſſary Pleaſures; in this we ſhall ſee it triumphing over the Natural and inſeparable Appetites of Man. What might not <hi>Abraham,</hi> if he had been under the Power of any Principle but that of Faith, have objected againſt this Command of God? what, ſhall I ſacrifice my Son, my only Son? This is a Sacrifice might become <hi>Baal</hi> or <hi>Moloch,</hi> but how unſuitable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that God I worſhip? Nor is
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:101160:144"/>
this leſs repugnant to his Veracity than his Goodneſs; Shall I ſacrifice the Son of the Promiſe? is it for this I have forſook my Home, my Countrey, my Birthright, and follow'd God through Inhoſpitable Deſarts, and more Inhoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Nations? are all my Expectations of a numerous and glorious Poſterity come to this at laſt? Thus might <hi>Abraham</hi> have argued, but having a firm belief of the Power, Goodneſs, and Faithfulneſs of God, he wou'd not go about to preſcribe his Wiſdom Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, or to limit his Omnipotence by unbelieving Fancies, or derogatory Conceptions concerning it, but firmly believing that he could do whatever he pleaſed, that he wou'd do whatever he proms'd; <hi>he that had received the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes offer'd up his only begotten Son, of whom it was ſaid, That in</hi> Iſaac <hi>thy Seed ſhall be called, accounting that God was able to raiſe him up even from the Dead; from whence alſo he received him in a Figure.</hi> We have ſeen Men vanquiſhing all the Pleaſures that the World can preſent us with, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all thoſe Inclinations and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:101160:145"/>
by which we are carried towards 'em. Faith in theſe Men encountred and defeated whatever ſtrength and force can be ſuppos'd either in Fancy or Imagination or in ſenſual Appetite, or in Natural Affection. The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion deducible from hence is, That there is no deſire of worldly Pleaſure in Man ſo vehement, but that it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd; and conſequently that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be neceſſarily betray'd into Sin by any inbred Inclination of this kind: there is but one Natural Principle more, from whence we can imagine any Neceſſity of ſinning to ariſe, which is an Averſion to all Pain or Trouble: there are therefore Temptations ſuited to this Principle in us, ſuch as deter us from our Duty, either by the ſenſe of preſent, or the fear of impending Evil: And it is thought to be the higheſt and difficulteſt trial of Vertue to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount theſe Temptations, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be vertuous when Virtue is immediately attended or viſibly threatned with great Evils. And yet behold,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In this Chapter numerous Inſtances of as great Conſtancy in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:101160:145"/>
Pain, as we have ſeen before of Continence in Rejecting Pleaſure, Verſ. 35, 36, 37. <hi>Others were tortur'd not accepting Deliverance, that they might obtain a better Reſurrection. And others had trial of Cruel Mockings and Scourgings, yea moreover of Bonds and Impriſonment, they were ſton'd, they were ſawn aſunder, were tempted, were ſlain with the Sword; they wandred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in Sheep-skins and Goat-skins being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented.</hi> See here Faith triumphing over all thoſe things that are the Dread and Terrour of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, Reproach, Impriſonment, Baniſhment, Death, Death in all its moſt affrightful Shapes, Death in all its variety of Torments, nay, many Deaths in the lingring Torments they were frequently put to; how ſtrong, how firm is this frail weak Nature when ſupported by a Divine Faith! All theſe expected a Happy Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they ſaw beyond theſe Midnight-Clouds the Dawnings of Eternity, and unſpeakable Comforts ready to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up and extinguiſh the memory of their Sufferings; and in this Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:101160:146"/>
they out-brav'd all ſorts of Evils. Nor is it to be wondred at, if Faith which overcomes the ſenſe of preſent Evils ſhou'd diſperſe the fears of future ones: Hence it was that the Parents of <hi>Moſes</hi> deſpis'd the Menaces of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> a Prince Arbitrary in his Power, Cruel in his Temper, reſolv'd and bloody in the Execution of Miſchief.— Hence it was that <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ſame manner deſpis'd the Wrath of this King, and well knowing that no place would be able to protect him from his Power and Cruelty but the Deſart, he forſook <hi>Egypt,</hi> and fled thither; where he could not but foreſee he was to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſuperable Difficulties; but he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd, <hi>as ſeeing him who is inviſible,</hi> and knew that the God of Heaven was every where preſent, &amp; that in deſpight of every thing under his Protection he ſhou'd be both Safe and Happy.</p>
                  <p>Now ſince there is no Evil the World can threaten us with equal to that of Torments and Death, it were vain and ſuperfluous after we have ſeen theſe Conquer'd, to fancy other Evils of a much ſlighter Nature unconquerable;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:101160:146"/>
it were abſurd to think that that Man could be frightned from his Duty by popular Reproach, or the Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of great Men, or the Diminution of his Eſtate, who cannot by Death it ſelf? 'twere abſurd to Fancy that he who deſpiſes Impriſonments, Stripes, Hunger, Nakedneſs, Torment in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Duty and reſpect to its Reward, ſhou'd be diſcouraged by any little Auſterities or Hardſhips which Vertue may ſometimes exact from him.</p>
                  <p>Tell me now then, you who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Corruption and Impotence of Man, you who magnifie the Force and Power of Temptation, and from both infer the Impoſſibility of being Vertuous and conſequently of being Happy, what have you to anſwer to theſe things, theſe Matters of Unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable Fact? you ſee Reſolution and Faith in theſe Examples rais'd to that height and ſtrength, which no Worldly no Carnal Temptation can reſiſt; tell me then why ſhou'd the Faith of a <hi>Jew</hi> out do that of a Chriſtian? were their Promiſes more Glorious and therefore
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:101160:147"/>
more Efficacious than ours? Look how far ſhort Time is of Eternity, Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Incorruption, ſo far was their <hi>Canaan</hi> of our Heaven: But ſuppoſe they had (as theſe ſure had) a Proſpect of the ſame Heaven, had they a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſight of it; or more convincing Evidence of the certainty of it than we have? Alas their <hi>Shechina, Bath-col,</hi> the Thunders and Lightnings of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> their Pillar of Cloud and Fire were not half ſo clear aſſurances of God amongſt 'em, as that Glory which ſhun in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, that Power Communicated from above to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus</hi> from the Dead, and his Aſcenſion into Heaven, were a manifeſt Teſtimony of God, aſſerting and bearing witneſs to the truth of our Religion, and particularly of that Fundamental Article in it, the Reſurrection of the Body, and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. What then, are our Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations greater than theirs? the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the moſt ſenſual Sinner dares not arrive at this Plea: Let the Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, the Ambitious confront his Temptations with the Enjoyments or
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:101160:147"/>
the Hopes of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Let the moſt afflicted, miſerable Man ballance his Temptations with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Sacrifice of his Son; or with the Sufferings of thoſe Righteous Men mention'd in the latter part of this Chapter, and he muſt confeſs, that his Temptations are as much weaker than their's, as is his Faith. What then can be ſaid? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, unleſs plainly this, that our Caſe is not the ſame with their's either in Reſpect of our Inclinations or our Aſſiſtances: if this were ſo, then how could theſe Men ſtand as a Cloud of Witneſſes againſt us in the laſt Day? which St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the following Chapter: how Natural wou'd it be for us, to wipe off any Accuſation or Reproach which their Vertue could faſten upon us by this eaſie anſwer? 'Tis true we were foil'd and o'rethrown by thoſe Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which theſe Men conquer'd, and well might this happen, for neither had they our Infirmities, nor we their Grace; their Nature was not ſo depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as our's, nor our Grace ſo ſufficient as their's. Were this ſo, the Sinner
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:101160:148"/>
might be more infortunate, but not more Criminal than the Saint; the different Event of things at the laſt Day were to be imputed to the different Diſpenſation not different uſe of Grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the partiality of God, not the negligence or wilfulneſs of Man, than which nothing can be more impiouſly or abſurdly affirm'd.</p>
                  <p>And now, let not hereafter a fancied Impoſſibility of Vertue diſcourage the Weak, nor a pretended one excuſe the wilful; nothing is more Evident than that there is no Inclination in Man that is Incorrigible, nor any temptation In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to our State which is Inſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Let any Man that pretends the contrary, conſider what Reaſon has done in ſome, what Cuſtom, what Faith in others; Let him himſelf try, what Reaſon, what Diſcipline, what Faith, (from all which I never ſeparate Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance) can do in him, and I am Confident, he will not then ſtand in need of any further anſwer to his Objection; his own ſucceſs as well as that of others, will be a ſufficient proof of its weakneſs: Thus I think I have
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:101160:148"/>
in general given a ſatisfactory anſwer to as many at leaſt as plead Natural Incapacity againſt the Poſſibility of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Happy: however that no Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, no ſcruple may remain, I will give a particular and clear thô brief anſwer to each part of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. There are three things ſuppos'd by it to render Man naturally incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Vertue and Happineſs. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and invincible Inclinations to Vice: againſt this, as the moſt conſiderable part of the Objection, the whole bent and force of the precedent Diſcourſe was levell'd, and therefore this needs no farther anſwer, only here it will be worth our remarking, That thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that are in the Natures and Tempers of Men are not Eſſential, but Accidental, and conſequently they may make the way to Happineſs more difficult to ſome than others, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to none. The ſtrongeſt Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Vertue (I ſpeak of that which is the reſult of Natural Temper) ſeems to me but a weaker Inclination to Vice, every Man has naturally a propenſion to Pleaſure, and conſequently the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:101160:149"/>
ſenſitive Part of us to ſenſitive Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; how much finer mould our our firſt Parents were made of than we are, I know not; but this I find, the Deſire of Pleaſure was Natural to 'em even in Innocence; This was that which the Beauty of the Apple did ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily enflame, and that was ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that I am not able to diſcern by the Text, to which I ſhou'd rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute their Sin and their loſs of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, to the Deſire of Knowledge, or the Deſire of Pleaſure: This tendency of the Senſitive Part is Natural to all, but in ſome 'tis more, in ſome leſs vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; unleſs we may ſay upon one ground, 'tis equal in all, for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Temper diſcovers it ſelf rather in the different kinds of Pleaſure we purſue, than in the different degrees of our Inclination to it; we are all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allur'd and drawn, yet not by the ſame but ſeveral Objects, ſo that if Luſt prevail in one, Ambition as much prevails in another, and Covetouſneſs in a third, and in others Intemperance or Sloth: So that the difficulty of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſeems much the ſame to all the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:101160:149"/>
Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> the ſtrength of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation conſiſting eſpecially in our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; not in the Excellency of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject we are taken with, but in our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to it: hence is it as Difficult for one Man to overcome his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, as to another to o'recome his Luſt; and reſtleſs toilſom Ambition is as luſcious and taking with ſome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers as lazy and delicious Luxury with others: if this were well-weighed, it would make us more mild and gentle in our Cenſure of others, and not ſo ſoft and eaſie in excuſing our ſelves. 'Tis further worth our obſerving here, that every Man's Vertue derives ſome tincture from his Conſtitution and Temper, ſo that generally ſpeaking, 'tis not difficult to gueſs a Man's Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſtitution by the Complexion of his Religion; however Vertue ceaſes not to be Vertue; nor will that ſlight Allay of the natural Conſtitution extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh its Vigour and Merit, thô it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooves every Man to keep a ſtrict and jealous guard upon his Inclinations, for Nature ſoon revives even after it has been ſome time Buried, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:101160:150"/>
moſt after that Perfection which does moſt contradict and oppoſe the particular Vice of his Conſtitution; for it will be otherwiſe morally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to gain a Conqueſt over it, and as impoſſible to gain a Rational Peace and Security without this Conqueſt.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Second</hi> thing which is ſuppoſed in the Objection to incapacitate Man for Happineſs is an unteachable ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, conſiſting in a ſlow Conception and treacherous Memory: 'Tis true indeed, the Heathen Philoſophers did require in their Scholars the Knowledg of many abſtruſe and difficult Matters, as antecedently neceſſary to Vertue and Happineſs, Skill in Mathematicks fitted a Man for the <hi>Platonic</hi> Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and the Knowledge of Natural things was the Foundation on which the <hi>Epicuraean</hi> pretended his Divine Happineſs and Vertue was to be built; and <hi>Seneca</hi> reckons the unthinking Croud amongſt the Beaſts that Periſh: all of 'em did with one conſent require three things to Compleat a Vertuous and Happy Man; Nature, Education or Inſtruction, and Cuſtom. To the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:101160:150"/>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> they attributed the Diſpoſition to Vertue; To the <hi>Second</hi> the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; To the <hi>Third,</hi> the Eaſineſs and Conſtancy; and to all three together the Perfection of it. And hence it is that they did diſtinguiſh between Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and Imperfect, between Political or Social and Philoſophical Vertue, and did not deem every Nature Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that Vertue which was Perfect and Philoſophical. But our bleſſed Lord and Maſter the Author of the Chriſtian Philoſophy requires no ſuch qualifications in thoſe who will be his Diſciples; All that he requires, is, an humble and an honeſt Mind, freed from proud Prejudices, poſſeſs'd with a ſincere Love of the Truth, and a ſincere Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of obeying it: accordingly St. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves that ſuch were moſt wrought upon by the Preaching of the Goſpel:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye ſee your Calling Brethren, how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called; But God has choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe: and God has choſen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty:
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:101160:151"/>
And baſe things of the world, and things that are deſpis'd has God choſen.</hi> Nor will any one imagine that Acute and Eminent parts are Neceſſary to render a Man capable of Being a Chriſtian, who ſhall conſider the Brevity and Plainneſs of the Chriſtian Faith and Law: doth it require a deep and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating Judgment, or a firm and tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Memory, to enable us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand or remember that plain and ſhort Summary of Chriſtian Practice?

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:101160:151"/>
to Man, not to the Goſpel, to the Pride and Superſtition of the one, not to the Obſcurity of the other: Nor may any one here with any ſhew of Reaſon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, That thô the ſubſtance of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith and Practice is clear, yet the Reaſons of both are not ſo; for who can ever imagine ſuch a Stupidity of Nature as can diſable any one to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Proofs by which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture eſtabliſhes the great Fundamental Article of our Faith, That <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Meſſias</hi> or <hi>Mediator</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man? or what Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of Nature can render it an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible Task to us to comprehend the two Fundamental Reaſons of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Righteouſneſs, namely, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency of it to the Happineſs of this, and of another Life, and the Holineſs of the God we Worſhip? I do not write this as if I mean't hereby to repreſent Induſtry in ſearch of Divine Truths, as Superfluous and un-neceſſary; but to aſſure all of how mean Capacities ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, of the ſucceſs of it. I am not Ignorant how much ſome applaud themſelves on the account of acquir'd
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:101160:152"/>
Knowledge of doubtful or abſtruſe things; how much others value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on a peculiar ſort of Politicks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote enough indeed from Vertue; and others on Accompliſhments as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from Reaſon, as the others Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks from Vertue; and how much all of 'em do deſpiſe the dulneſs of thoſe who cannot, and the ſimplicity of thoſe who ſtrive not to equal 'em in theſe Attainments: But all this doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in me the leaſt Scruple or Suſpition of the Truth I have before aſſerted; I know that our Duty is plain, and that the Path of Duty is the moſt direct and Compendious one to the Happineſs of this life and of another: for I know that nothing is ſo taking with God as an humble Faith, Devout, Pure, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Charitable Religion. As to worldly Happineſs I know that a Man's own Vertue ſupported by God's Spirit, and guided by his Truth is the ſafeſt and the plaineſt Guide he can follow in Dark and Tempeſtuous times; true Policy conſiſts not in that Addreſs or ſubtilty of Spirit, which furniſhes a Man at all times with plauſible Shifts,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:101160:152"/>
but in that Integrity and Vertue that needs none: and the Beauty and Life of Converſation conſiſts not in Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Faces, Phantaſtick Dreſſes, Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Motions, Shrugs and Cringes, much leſs in Mechanick (for ſo I may call ſet forms of Chat) but in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, diligent and faithful diſcharge of the Duties we owe to all thoſe ſeveral Relations we ſtand in, and the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of thoſe Laws of Converſation which true Philoſophy preſcribes; This is that which will make us acceptable to all, and dear to the Wiſe and Good; Slights, and Tricks, and Arts may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and entertain, but Vertues do charm and captivate, thoſe may open us the way to mens Houſes and their Tables, but theſe to their Boſoms to their Hearts.

and Conſtancy, have moſt of Heat and Paſſion in Religion, and thoſe Minds which are worſt furniſh't with Courage and Experience, with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reſolution are moſt apt and eaſie to be mov'd and wrought upon by Religious, or deluded by Superſtitious Fears; and as apt to be tenderly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Repreſentations of Divine Goodneſs and Compaſſion; ſo that like Bodies which have leſs bulk, but more agility, their Motion's nimbler, thô their, force and ſtrength be leſs. Now if this be ſo, then the Diſadvantage of this Temper is not ſo great as it is fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, for though their Paſſions laſt not long, they are eaſily rais'd; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, if our Addreſſes to ſuch a Temper be but a little more frequently repeated, they cannot but prove ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, and ſuch Perſons by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Returns of Holy Paſſions will grow habitually devout, and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion will be as ſteady and more elevated than that of a ſlower and firmer Conſtitution: But after all wherever there appears an Exuberancy of this Humour, this is to be imputed
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:101160:154"/>
rather to their Fortune than their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; a wanton Fortune and too indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent an Education is generally attended with a gay, wanton and unfix't Mind. And 'tis true that it is a difficult Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ſuch Minds as theſe to attain to Wiſdom and Vertue, but 'tis not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot conſider, but becauſe they will not; let but ſuch exchange their haunts of Pleaſure for the Houſe of Mourning; let 'em but now and then intermix the Converſation of the wiſe and ſerious with that of the giddy, fanciful, and frolickſom; and they will ſoon find their Humour much corrected, and their Minds better fix'd; to all this, if they could be perſwaded to add the Contemplation of a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saviour, of a Holy God and of a Judgment to come; and to this the Devotion of the Cloſet made up of ſerious Reflexion on theſe Subjects and their own Eternity, this wou'd ſoon reduce their looſe and ſcatter'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, it wou'd ſoon recall the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, wandring Mind, and make it delight to dwell at home in the Company of Wiſe, Devout and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Thoughts.</p>

Do Men complain of their heavineſs and ſtupidity? acute Parts and a tenacious Memory are not neceſſary to make us Vertuous or Happy; do they complain of their violent Inclinations to Sin? I have ſhew'd 'em Reaſon, Cuſtom, Faith, curbing and ſubduing the moſt Natural or the moſt outragious and ungover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Appetites of Man: do they Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Levity and Inconſtancy of their Temper? let 'em retire from the Flatteries and Careſſes of a wanton For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and a wanton Converſation; let 'em acquaint themſelves with the Wiſe or the Afflicted, with Divine Truths and their Cloſets, and this will ſoon work a Happy change upon 'em, if they are too ſoft and delicate for the bitterneſs and ſeverity of theſe Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nothing but the much ſeverer Diſcipline of Afflictions and Judgments can effect their Cure. Under this Head of Natural Incapacity that other Objection from Moral Incapacity has been ſufficiently anſwer'd, for Cuſtom

four Heads. <hi>First,</hi> That the Grace of God is neceſſary to enable us to live Vertuouſly and Happily; <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Grace does not extinguiſh Nature, or cancel our Obligation to Induſtry or a careful uſe of that Natural Power God has inveſted us with; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That God is moſt ready and deſirous to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and aſſiſt all Men in their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after Vertue and Happineſs: <hi>And laſtly,</hi> That the Grace of God is ſufficient for us, or, that we receive by it as great an addition of Strength or Spiritual Aid, as being joyn'd with our ſincere Endeavours, is neceſſary to make us Vertuous and Happy: if we deny the firſt of theſe, we ſubvert the Foundation of Prayer to and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon God, we can give no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable account of at leaſt one third part of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and we unavoidably diſcourage Mankind from all hopes of Happineſs; if we deny the ſecond, we deſtroy the very Nature of Man, render all Laws, Exhortations, Admonitions, Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſeleſs, ſilly and impertinent; and make Divine Grace the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:101160:159"/>
of carnal Security, of deſperate and deſtructive Negligence and Sloth: if we deny the third or fourth, we muſt unavoidably affirm, either that the Happineſs of Man does no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Grace of God, or that his Miſery is fatal and unavoidable: All which are Abſurdities groſs and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all Minds which lie not under the thickeſt darkneſs of blind Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Prejudice.

                     <note place="margin">Of Penal Incapacity.</note>Penal Incapacity conſiſts in God's final and immutable rejection of Man from Grace and Pardon.

                  <p>Secondly, Since Impenitence and Hardneſs of heart is a Neceſſary and inſeparable Conſequence of that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sentence which excludes Men from Grace and Pardon; therefore no Man can rationally conclude himſelf in this ſtate, till he has made all poſſible at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to recover himſelf from his Sin, and that without ſucceſs; And becauſe,</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, No man can conclude his Endeavours unſucceſsful, till Death ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe him in an Obdurate and Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſtate; for habitual Sinners have become eminent Saints, and laps't Chriſtians, nay Apoſtates have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recover'd their former ſtate, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd their Crimes by more than Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary degrees of Repentance, Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Charity, and by unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Conſequence have been reſtor'd to God's Favour; for Grace is in order to Pardon, Sanctification in order to

Juſtification, Vertue in order to Glory; therefore no Man muſt give over his Attempts of appeaſing God, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing his Corruptions, while God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues him in the Land of the Living: Theſe Rules if obſerved will, I queſtion not render the Perſwaſion of ſuch a <hi>Penal</hi> ſtate, as the Objection ſuppoſes, very profitable and uſeful to ſome, and not pernicious to the eternal Intereſt of any: For he who by the Dread of ſuch a ſtate, is deterr'd from bold and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking Sins, and from an habitual Courſe of wilful Impiety, reaps an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Advantage by it; and he who adheres to Religion and Vertue, and continues to his life's End, ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavouring to pleaſe God and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Pardon, ſhall never ſuffer any Prejudice in another life by his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and miſtaken Fancies in this.

or at leaſt leſs capable than that of a Plough-man; indeed this ſtate when active and glorious is full of Fears, and Cares, and Hazards; when ſluggiſh and unactive full of ſhame: what can be the Happineſs of a ſtate too big for Friendſhip or for Pleaſure? for love is the Buſineſs and Enjoyment of Equals; Obedience is all Subjects can offer, or indeed Monarchs can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; All higher and nearer approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the Throne are but Intruſions of Ambition and Deſign: Nor can I poſſibly diſcern what Satisfaction the great Mortal can take in any Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Duty or Affection, which he can never diſtinguiſh from the fawning and flattery of thoſe who in their hearts deſpiſe and hate him: How ſhall he know that any truly love him, when none dare ſlight him? or how ſhall he diſcern who ſerves him out of Duty, where every Man even obtrudes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon his Commands out of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt?

Men, but with Faces, or rather Masks and Diſguiſes.

For the ſame Reaſon I do not call Men happy, whoſe ſlow and eaſie Temper like the

I would not have my life paſs by like a Dream, whil'ſt fleeting or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Images of things do ſcarce awake, and too too ſlightly affect my drouzy or dazled ſenſe. In a word, the Happineſs I ſeek after is ſuch a one which is owing neither to Natural Conſtitution, nor to Fortune: for then, it would not be in our Power.

how Happy that Soul which was illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with Divine Knowledge, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by an unſhaken Faith, fill'd with joyful Reflexions and glorious Hopes? that Soul which in the ſilence of the Night, and the Retirements of the Mount did pour forth it ſelf in Prayers and Hallelujah's, that Soul which full of God and full of Heaven, had no room for uneaſie Cares or afflicting Sorrows? 'tis true, our Saviour met Death with pale looks and melancholy pangs of Soul; but 'tis as true, that his Faith ſurmounted his Fears, his Agony endur'd but for a little while an undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd Peace, and a well-ſettled ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Mind immediately follow'd it, and his trouble and Pain in Death, like the Ecclipſe that attended it, did but o'recaſt and darken the joy, the light within, not extinguiſh it: who could finiſh the laſt Act of Life with more humble Majeſty, or with more ſettled Peace? in the Life and Death of our dear Lord we behold that of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for they were all Followers of him, as they deſir'd we ſhould be of them: what can be happier than their

                  <p>Let it ſtand then as an unſhaken Truth, That Happineſs may be attain'd in this Life; for what the Followers of our Lord and Maſter attain'd to, that may we; their Natural Paſſions and Infirmities were the ſame with our's, our Trials and Temptations are far leſs than theirs; we ſerve the ſame God, we are guided by the ſame Truths, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the ſame Power, elevated by the ſame Hopes; we have the ſame Peace bequeath'd us, the ſame Spirit, the ſame Heaven promis'd us, and we march under the Conduct of the ſame Captain of our Salvation, who <hi>by his Death has Aboliſh't Death, and brought Life and Immortality to Light.</hi> Nor ought this to ſeem to us an over-daring or preſumptuous Poſition, ſince the Poſſibility of Happineſs is a Notion
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:101160:165"/>
Conſonant to the Common ſenſe of all Mankind: for 'tis Happineſs which Laws enacted for the Government of the Multitude, and Philoſophical Rules preſcrib'd for the Government of our Paſſions, do aim at; All Law-givers have ever promis'd the people Wealth, and Peace, and Glory, and Security, as the fruits of their Obedience: and all Philoſophers have ever promis'd Tranquillity of Mind and Rational Pleaſure to their Followers as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Conformity to their Precepts: And as it cannot ſurely be deny'd, but that the Kingdom is moſt Happy, which by juſt Laws and a well-tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd Authority, is freed from thoſe Fears and Diſtractions, from thoſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and Confuſions to which others are expos'd by Anarchy or Tyranny by the Inſolence of the Multitude, or the Impotence of the Prince; ſo it cannot be deny'd, but that the Man is moſt Happy, whoſe well-ſettled Peace is eſtabliſh't upon ſolid Grounds of true Wiſdom; being neither oppreſs'd by the Tyranny of Superſtition, nor vex't and diſquieted by the Inſolence of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly

Paſſions, to which the weakneſs of <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſubjects Men. As to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is a third governing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, this only propoſes a more perfect Happineſs, and a more plain and direct way to it, than Nature of it ſelf could: it only relieves and recruits our Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Power by that of Grace, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the Light of Reaſon by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of new Rays of Revelation. If then Happineſs be the great End which Law and Philoſophy, Revelation and Reaſon, God and Man, do unanimouſly propoſe to us, how abſurd and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Contradiction were it to all theſe, to deny the Attainment of it poſſible?</p>
                  <p>To look back now upon this whole Chapter,<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</note> and ſum up the ſubſtance and force of it, 'tis this, God who made us, made us on purpoſe to be Happy; for what other deſign could Infinite Love propoſe to it ſelf in our Creation? and propoſing to himſelf this End, he endow'd us with Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Capacities that might fit us for the Contemplation and Enjoyment of himſelf, and of his Works: The World
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:101160:166"/>
provided by him for our Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he filled with all things that could Miniſter either to our Neceſſities or Delights: here God has planted us, not as Inhabitants but Sojourners; for this is but our ſtate of Probation, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels had their times of Trial, ſo have Men; here he wou'd have us aſpire after, as near as we can, that life Angels lead in Heaven; for we are one Day to be equal to 'em: here he wou'd have us learn and practiſe thoſe Vertues which fit us for the Society &amp; Enjoyment of that Kingdom where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in dwells Righteouſneſs, for that is the bleſſed End and Conſummation of all our Endeavours, Deſires and Hopes; but when we make Heaven the Abode, the Seat of Perfect Happineſs, we do not thereby ſuppoſe that it is baniſh't from the Earth, but rather on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if that ſtate be the Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things, 'tis Neceſſarily to be concluded that every ſtep we advance nearer to it, we mount and aſcend higher, into brighter, calmer and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Regions: Heaven is like a Glorious Building, whoſe acceſs is full of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:101160:166"/>
and Beauty; for as that Youth which precedes our Manhood, has its Sweetneſs, its Beauty, its natural Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Pleaſure; ſo has this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal-ſtate which precedes our Angelical, its proper Degree of Perfection and Bleſſedneſs: and this is no ſmall one neither, for as we are created but a little lower than the Angels in reſpect to the Dignity of our Nature, ſo ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Happineſs begins nearly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and reſemble theirs: When our Mind fill'd with Divine Truths, Charity and Hope becomes Free, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, Reſolv'd, Conſtant, Chearful, Meek, Gentle, Devout Heavenly: when it has ſo accuſtom'd it ſelf to Vertue, and familiarly acquainted it ſelf with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that the Sins and Pleaſures of the ſenſual Part of the World look like the Manners and Entertainments, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a Foreign, but Barbarous and Impoveriſh't Countrey; and when laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by its frequent Retirements from the Body and daily Commerce with Rational and Spiritual Pleaſures, it not only aſſerts its Soveraignty over it, but begins to live ſo independent of it, that
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:101160:167"/>
at the laſt when it ſhall in Death mount up upon the Wings of pure Flame to Heaven, it ſhall not ſuffer as if the Body needed to be torn from it, but ſhall let it fall, as <hi>Elijah</hi> did his Mantle. Thoſe Complaints therefore which we make againſt our preſent ſtate, and thoſe Reproaches with which we outrage and vilifie our Nature, are falſe and unjuſt, for we are by God created and deſign'd for Happineſs, and this Happineſs God hath been pleas'd to put in our own power to place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our reach: There is no Fate, but what God has made us our ſelves Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters of; we lye under no Neceſſity, no Fatality, but what our own Vices betray us to; Nor do we ſtand in need of the Indulgences of Fortune, the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and Pleaſure of a Vertuous Man is an Image of God's own; it ſprings from within, not from without; 'tis true there are Difficulties which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct our Progreſs to Happineſs; but they are ſuch as all Wiſe and Good Men have conquer'd: 'tis true, Nature labours under its Infirmities, that is, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Propenſions and Inclinations; but
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:101160:167"/>
it is ſtrengthen'd and ſupported by Reaſon, by Revelation, by Grace: we may fall ('tis true) a Sacrifice to God's Wrath, but it muſt be after we have liv'd long in Contempt of his Mercy, and obſtinate Defyance of his Grace. Methinks theſe Conſiderations ſhould raiſe and exalt the Mind of Man, they ſhould inſpire us with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Hopes worthy of Rational and Immortal Souls, like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they march't out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> we ſhould dream of nothing but Triumph, Glory, and Happineſs.</p>

                  <hi>Tully</hi>'s Wiſe man, a mere Idea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing no where to be found but in the Characters and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions which Philoſophers give us of him, this were an unconquerable Diſcouragement; no Briskneſs of Wit, no Charms of Fancy, no force of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, no height of Spirits or heat of Confidence were ſufficient to remove it, and to engage Men in ſuch a Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and unaccountable Enterprize as this Suppoſition would render the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of Happineſs: for how fond and groundleſs a Preſumption were it to purſue that which all Mankind had ever as Unſucceſsfully as Earneſtly and Indefatigably attempted? I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavoured with all my might in the former Chapter to free men's Minds from any Suſpition or Fears of this Kind, anſwering all Objections that might ſeem to repreſent <hi>Miſery fatal,</hi> or <hi>Happineſs unattainable,</hi> and by unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable proofs Confirming the Oppoſite Truth. But if this be true, that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is attainable, and if it be as true,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:101160:169"/>
as certainly 'tis, that there needs no Eloquence to enkindle in any Man the Deſires of Happineſs, or to incite and ſpur him on to Endeavour its Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all Mankind being carried on towards it by Natural, and therefore Conſtant and Paſſionate Inclinations: will it not be Natural to demand, Whence is it that ſo few are Happy? Whence is it that Miſery and Trouble, Affliction and Sorrow fill almoſt every place and every Boſome? Not only no Kingdom or City, but no Town, no Village, no Family, I might almoſt add no one particular Perſon, being exempt and free; no place or perſon is privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd againſt Grief and Trouble, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the Tribunal of Judges, the Thrones of Princes, and what is almoſt as ſacred as either, the Retirements and Cloſets of the Devout and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; nay ſcarcely is the Church and the Altar a ſecure Sanctuary againſt it.</p>
               <p>This will not be difficult to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, if we do thorowly weigh and ſoberly conſider the true Cauſes of Man's Miſery; but the particular and

               <p>Many are the particular Cauſes of Humane Miſery,<note place="margin">Deviation from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Cauſe of Man's Miſery.</note> but they may <hi>all</hi> be reduc'd to this Univerſal and Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate One, Namely, <hi>That we do not live Conformable to our Reaſon.</hi>

               <p>When do our Affections ſpring from, or when are they govern'd by Reaſon? When are our Deſires or Fears, our Joys or Sorrows Wife, and Juſt, and Rational and Holy? how frequently are our Actions nothing elſe but the bruitiſh and blind Sallies of fooliſh Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and our lives are generally no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Wandrings and Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of deluded Imaginations?

to our Reaſon, and ſometimes to our Inclinations too: How unlike are we in our Converſation to our ſelves in our Retirement? how unlike are we in the Devotions of our Cloſets to our ſelves in the Employment of our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Profeſſions? how calm, ſedate, wiſe, holy, and reſolv'd in the one? how an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious and uneaſie, how fooliſh, earthy, and inconſtant in the other? but in nothing does our Deviation from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more evidently appear than in two things.</p>

ſome unneceſſary Accompliſhment, not Vertue and Goodneſs, or a vain Eſteem and popular Applauſe, not the Peace and Wiſdom of his Mind? who ſees not how greedily Men purſue thoſe ſenſual Satisfactions which naturally tend to enſlave the Soul, and to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the rational Pleaſure and Vigour of our Minds? In a word, Wealth, and Honour, and Power, and Pleaſure, are the Idols of Mankind, theſe are the things for which they live, for which they love and value life; theſe are the glorious Poſſeſſions which enflame our Emulations and our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; theſe are the things which the Unfortunate man Envies, and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Honours; theſe are the things which diſtinguiſh and diſcriminate Mankind into their ſeveral Ranks and Degrees, the Contempt or Eſteem of the World, the Reſpects and Affronts, the Love and Hate of Mankind being ever proportion'd to the Degrees of Wealth and Power which they fancy others poſſeſſed of.

This is too too Evident to any one who ſhall conſider how fond we are of our Diſeaſes and our Errors, how Impatient of that Inſtruction or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof which tends to Cure, undeceive and diſabuſe us, how ſluggiſh we are in the ſtudy of Important Truths, how liſtleſs and remiſs in the uſe of thoſe means which conduce to Vertue, to the freeing our Minds, and to the Confirming our Reſolutions: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laſtly how light, wavering and unconſtant we are in the Practice of thoſe things which Right Reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces us to be our Duty. All this is plain and Evident, we ſee and feel it and bemoan it, but yet we live on in the ſame manner ſtill; whence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:101160:171"/>
is this Infatuation of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that enſlaves us to falſe and irrational Ends? whence is that Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Mind? whence is that Inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity that deludes our Deſires, and produces nothing but feeble and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful Endeavours? neither is this a difficult Matter to diſcover; that we live and act irrationally proceeds evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently from <hi>three</hi> Cauſes. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Contexture and Frame of our Nature. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A vitious Education. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Vitious Converſation.</p>

               <p>Firſt, We muſt propoſe to our ſelves a Rational and wiſe End of Life; that is, the true Happineſs of a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creature: When we have done this, when our Underſtandings are fully convinc't and perſwaded of the Excellence and Neceſſity of it, and when we have poſſeſs'd our Minds with a ſacred Reverence, a firm and devout Love for it: This like the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Star the <hi>Magi,</hi> will lead us through all the windings and turnings of Life to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> and Happineſs; this will ſoon diſingage us from that <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of Contradictious Deſires and wild O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, in which the Fool and Sinner is endleſly entangled. When we have done this, we ſhall find every place a School, every one we Converſe with a Tutor, and every paſſage of our Life, or another's full of Inſtruction: Not a look whether Chearful or Melancholy; not a word whether wiſe or fooliſh; not a Sigh that an oppreſs'd Heart vents, not a Joy that ſmiles in the face but will teach us Philoſophy; ſhew us
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:101160:183"/>
the Uſe and Beauty of Divine Truth and Divine Vertue; for in the Vicious, we ſhall ſee what falſe and fading Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, what idle fears, what vain ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, falſe Principles, and the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Sin fills their Minds with; in the Good we ſhall ſee, what true Peace, Vertue creates in the Mind, what Conſtancy and Majeſty in the Life, what Courage and Hopes it inſpires in Affliction, what Magnanimity and Humility in Proſperity; and in a word, what Light, what Serenity it diffuſes through the whole Man: we ſhall ſee in many Inſtances every Day, what the Miſchief of irrational Deſires and ungovernable Paſſions are; and on the contrary, how great the Advantages, how charming the Beauty of Truth and Vertue, of Wiſdom and the Due Government and Regulation of all our Paſſions: Nor is the Inſtruction and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of our Underſtanding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by every Accident which falls under our Obſervation, and by all ſorts of People, with whom we converſe: the only Advantage which we ſhall reap from the prefixing our ſelves a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:101160:183"/>
End of Life, and the poſſeſſing our Souls with the Love of it; for when we have done this, we ſhall be actually freed from the greater part at leaſt of the Troubles and Calamities of Life, we ſhall be rais'd above all ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſilly Deſires, and conſequently above all ſenſeleſs, ſilly Vexations and Griefs, and unmanly Complaints: for when we have ſet our Hearts upon true and rational Happineſs, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, nay how deſpicable will moſt of thoſe things appear which we now admire and Covet: we ſhall not then think it reaſonable to ſigh and toil for this Houſe or that Land, for this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment or that Trade, this Honour or that Beauty, for theſe are no Eſſential, no Neceſſary Ingredients of a Rational Happineſs. Nor is this all, thy Joys and Pleaſures will grow and increaſe upon thee; for by approaching every day nearer and nearer to thy great End, thou wilt be wonderfully ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd with freſh Delight, whil'ſt thou do'ſt behold the fruit of thy Travail, the Advantage of thy Philoſophy, and the daily increaſe of thy Wealth: thou wilt
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:101160:184"/>
ſee thy ſelf, like a thriving Plant grow up daily more ſtrong and beautiful: the toil of others ſorts to no Happy End, The Covetous Man grows not Richer by Heaping up, nor the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Man greater by riſing higher, or at leaſt neither grows Happier by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either Richer or Greater; but thou wilt every day grow wiſer by ſtudy, more Vertuous by Practice, Calmer and Happier by both. O to what a height and Perfection will thy Pleaſure riſe, when thy ſtore ſhall grow big enough to Feaſt and Entertain not thy ſelf only, but all Men elſe; when the thirſty ſhall come and drink at thy Streams, and the ſcorch't ſhall refreſh themſelves under thy ſhade; when thou led by the ſame Spirit with our great Lord and Maſter ſhalt open the Eyes of the Blind, and the Ears of the Deaf, ſhalt caſt out Devils and ſtrengthen the Feet of the Lame; I mean, when thou ſhalt teach the fooliſh Wiſdom, when thou ſhalt perſwade and Charm the Obſtinate, when thou ſhalt deliver the Unclean and the Paſſionate from the Evil Spirits, the Vices that poſſeſs'd
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:101160:184"/>
'em, and when thou ſhalt teach the Enſlav'd and Impotent Sinner, how to overcome the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, thou wilt then indeed, as thou art the Image, ſo do the Works of God, thou wilt be a Heavenly and Tutelar thô mortal Angel amongſt Men; and wherever <hi>thou</hi> doſt, there <hi>Wiſdom, Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> will dwell too. But to attain to this ſtate, 'tis not only Neceſſary to prefix our ſelves a Rational End of Life; But alſo</p>
               <p>Secondly, We muſt purſue this End with Life, and Spirit, and Conſtancy. It is not a good Fit or a Devout Paſſion that will make us either Vertuous or Happy, there muſt go more than this to conquer an ill habit, or implant a good one; 'tis not one brisk Sally, or one warm Charge that will ſubdue the World and Fleſh, and put us into an entire Poſſeſſion of Victory and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; No, when Warmth and Paſſion have made a proſperous Impreſſion on the Enemy, a ſober Patience muſt make good the ground we have gain'd, a ſteady and reſolved Courage muſt urge and preſs the Advantage to an Iſſue;
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:101160:185"/>
without Vigour, Patience &amp; Conſtancy to carry us ſtill forwards, the warmth and Paſſion with which we begin the Courſe of Vertue, will ſtand us in little ſtead; Ah! how many have march't out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and periſh't in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs! how many have wreck't within ſight of Shore? How many have loſt their Reward of Repentance by their Relapſe and Revolt? how many have fallen by Negligence, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and Sloth into that wretched ſtate, out of which they had once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd themſelves by Courage, and Reſolution, and Self-denial? Nor is the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of Vigour, Patience, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, in our purſuit of Happineſs, the only Motive to it; the <hi>Certainty of Succeſs</hi> and the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> and <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> of the Advantages, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it are ſufficient to animate and encourage any Man that ſeriouſly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders it: the Labour and Hope of the Husbandman is loſt, unleſs the fruitful Earth, and fruitful Seed be bleſs'd with fruitful Seaſons too; The Trade of the Merchant is properly but Adventuring, and his increaſe depends as much on
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:101160:185"/>
Winds and Waves, and other as uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Chances, as on his own Skill and Diligence: Fortune muſt aſſiſt the Courage and the Conduct of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, or elſe Poverty and Diſhonour will be the only purchaſe of his Blood and hazard; But it fares not thus with Man in his purſuit of true Happineſs, the Traffick of the Philoſopher depends not upon Winds nor Tide, the Seeds of Vertue, if the Ground be well Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated will thrive in any Weather, and ſometimes better in Storms than Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, and finally the ſucceſs of our Conflicts againſt Sin and Miſery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not on our Fortune, but our Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and our Induſtry. How unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Pleaſure is it now to think that we cannot be diſappointed in our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, nor defeated of our Hopes, while we Labour for Vertue and Happineſs, if our Endeavours be ſincere and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, our ſucceſs is certain and unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable; but what an acceſſion doth this Pleaſure receive when we conſider, what will be the glorious fruit of this Succeſs, Tranquillity, Chearfulneſs, Greatneſs and Enlargement of Soul, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:101160:186"/>
Pleaſure, Life, Immortality, Security, and in one word Happineſs. O Glorious reward of our Conflict and our Victories! what neither Wealth nor Greatneſs, nor Honour nor Crowns; what neither Blood nor Toil, nor Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nor Fortune can give! that Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and ſincere Endeavours after Wiſdom and Vertue will give the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man upon Earth, that is, <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!</hi> O Bleſſed Iſſue of Philoſophical, that is, truly Chriſtian Travail! the Rich, the Great the Honourable, the Mighty may Complain even of their ſucceſs, and repent 'em of the Purchaſe they have made at too dear a Rate; but the Philoſopher, the Chriſtian can never repent of the ſucceſs of his Study, his Self-denial, his Patience, his Prayers: for how is it poſſible to complain of being Happy, or repent of being Wiſe and Vertuous? there is nothing Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nothing Evil, nothing Mean, nothing Uncertain in true Wiſdom, in Rational Happineſs.</p>
               <p>This brief &amp; general Account of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, &amp; of the way to it, does naturally inſtruct us how we are to treat the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:101160:186"/>
and what it is that a <hi>Rational Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>wiſe Converſation</hi> ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and aim at, if our Conformity to Reaſon be either the Happineſs of this preſent Life or the Immediate Cauſe of it, (for I will not trouble my ſelf with Nice and ſubtle Diſtinctions in Moral Diſcourſes) then 'tis plain that we are oblig'd to ſuch a kind of Diſcipline and Government of our ſelves as may render the Body moſt Obſequious to the Mind, and may exalt and eſtabliſh the Power and Dominion of Reaſon; for whatever tends to obſcure our Underſtanding, to enfeeble the Will, to cheriſh our ſenſual Inclinations, and augment their force and violence, doth ſo far Neceſſarily tend to deprave the Nature of Man, and to ſubvert and o'rethrow his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and from hence it appears that the Excellence of Education conſiſts in poſſeſſing the Minds of Youth with wiſe Principles, with true Notions of Good and Evil, and informing and moulding their Minds into an Eſteem and veneration for Wiſdom and Vertue. The firſt Vertue I conceive a Child ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of is Obedience, and this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:101160:187"/>
the Foundation of all Vertue: to this let him be inur'd and train'd up betimes, he that finds it eaſie to obey another's Reaſon, will not find it diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to obey his own; for when the judgment comes to be form'd and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, when it comes to exerciſe its Authority, it will find a Body not us'd to give, but receive Commands; from this vertue of Obedience he is to be led gently on to a Rational and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Choice of what is good, he muſt be taught gradually not only his plain Duty, but the Motives to it; for it is as neceſſary to his Happineſs that he ſhould love, as that he ſhould know his Duty: But this we ſtrive in vain to inſtill by Art and Inſtruction, if we do not inſtill it by the Influence and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of wiſe and excellent Examples too.</p>
               <p>As to Converſation 'tis plain, that it ought to be the Practice of thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which a Pious Education inſtill'd, and that we ought to have no leſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for our Reaſon, when we are at our own Diſpoſal, and under our own Government, than we had for the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:101160:187"/>
Authority of our Parents when we were under their's: what ought to be the tie and Ligaments of Friendſhip, what the Rules of Converſation, and what the great Ends of Society, is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly manifeſt from the Nature of that Happineſs which it behoves us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as the great End of Life; what is the great End of Man ought to be the Deſign of Society; and therefore 'tis plain that Wiſdom and Vertue ought to be the foundation and bond of thoſe Friendſhips which we enter into, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily and of Choice, That Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſhou'd be ſo regulated that we may grow by it more Wiſe and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, or at leaſt that our Diſcourſe, if it be not profitable ſhou'd be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and that we ſhou'd do and ſay nothing in Company which we ſhou'd have Reaſon to bluſh at, or repent of in private.</p>
               <p>I have now finiſh't this Diſcourſe which I deſign'd only as an Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to, or Preparative for thoſe which are to follow: I do not think, that 'tis now Neceſſary for me in a Pathetic Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, to perſwade Men to endeavour
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:101160:188"/>
to be <hi>Happy;</hi> the Deſires of Happineſs are inſeparable from all Beings, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe 'tis impoſſible to be Rational and not deſire to be Happy: if I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſufficiently prov'd that 'tis poſſible to be Happy, and if I have ſhew'd that a diligent Enquiry, a vigorous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering Induſtry is Neceſſary to the Attainment of it; if I have pointed out the general Cauſes of Humane Miſery, and together with 'em their general Cure and Remedy. I have done en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
